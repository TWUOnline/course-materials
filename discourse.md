## Welcome to TWU Online Discourse!

At TWU Online we use Discourse, a discussion platform where you can connect with other TWU students, ask questions about your courses, share assignment advice, and build an online community. There are Forums specific to your course, your program, and online learning tools.  Please make this forum work for you!  Interact with your peers, learn from each other, and make connections that will stay with you beyond this course.
