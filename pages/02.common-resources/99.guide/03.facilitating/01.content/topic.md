[details="What is Facilitation?"]

When you first heard of the title, ‘Global Academic Facilitator’, you may have been curious as to what that term means. To ‘facilitate’ something refers to making an action or process easier (Oxford definition), and a facilitator of learning is someone who does whatever is necessary to ensure that learning can happen in a given environment. This could be through administering learning materials, coaching students individually, teaching content in a group setting, providing tech support, or whatever is needed for students to have a comprehensive learning experience.

Vaughan refers to facilitation as “the central activity of teaching in an educational community of inquiry that emerges from the activity between students and instructor”(p.46). Thus, in most face-to-face learning environments, the primary learning facilitator is the instructor and sees facilitative duties as a central part of their role. Nevertheless, facilitating a quality, transformational learning experience is a big role, and teaching assistants, learning coaches and educational administrators are there to perform supplemental facilitation duties roles so the instructor doesn’t have to. In that sense, facilitation of learning is a multifaceted endeavor, and it often takes a joint effort from several educational professionals to serve a learning community.

In an international online learning community, facilitating becomes even more complex. The instructor does their best to facilitate learning through online platforms, but because there are added barriers to learning, such as proximity and culture differences, it can be challenging for instructors to provide their students with the support they need.  Studies have shown that many students who attempt to take online courses from overseas institutions are not successful, and this is often linked to the nuanced cultural differences in Western education and online learning technologies that students have no easy way to understand. It may be more cost-effective to complete international degrees virtually in their home country, but it comes with significant challenges.

At TWU Global, we believe that while there are barriers to creating successful international online learning communities, it is not impossible with some restructuring of how facilitation will work in this environment. In addition to the online instructor, GLOBAL has designed a blended online learning program that relies on their academic facilitator to fill in these gaps in international online higher education. The role of the academic facilitator is to supplement the instructors’ facilitation duties by providing face-to-face coaching, administration, learning facilitation, and IT support for the students who are taking the courses at their campus. They do not instruct the course, but they provide direction for how students approach their courses and bridge any gaps in learning.


As a facilitator at a FAR Center, some of your primary duties will :

•	Plan and lead weekly Learning Labs that correspond with the units in the students courses

•	Provide both group and individual coaching in developing critical thinking skills, understanding major concepts and academic writing

•	Oversee the students completion of their courses

•	Facilitate quizzes and exams

•	Help students with technological difficulties

As you embark on your journey as a facilitator, your understanding of your own role will expand and shape according to where you are. Facilitators have a multilayered yet essential role that is informed by context, students and learning outcomes, and it requires flexibility, discernment and a readiness to learn.

[details="Key Principles"]

Here is an overview of some key concepts you should keep in mind when you begin to plan and deliver your sessions. You will explore more around these concepts as you take your Graduate Certificate in Facilitation and Coaching, and you will have more resources to draw from as you complete each course.


## Androgogy
![](image-4.jpeg)

As you plan your learning activities, keep in mind these six assumptions about andragogy from Knowles (1980 cited in Merriam & Bierma, 2014, p.47)

1.  As a person matures, his or her self-concept moves from that of a dependent personality toward one of a **self-directing** human being.

2.  An adult accumulates a growing reservoir of **experience**, which is a rich resource for learning.

3.  The readiness of an adult to learn is closely related to the **developmental tasks** of his or her social role.

4.  There is a change in time perspective as people mature – from future application of knowledge to immediacy of **application**. Thus, an adult is more problem than subject centered in learning.

5.  Adults are mostly driven by **internal motivation**, rather than external motivators.

6.  Adults need to know the **reason** for learning something.

Here are a couple more beliefs about adult learning that place a primary emphasis on the role of critical thinking. (Brookfield, 2013, Knowles, 1970, Merriam & Caffarella, 1999, Schon, 1983,Vygotsky, 1978):

* Adults are self-directed and self-motivated. This does not mean that adults learn in isolation but that they are in charge of their own learning and held accountable.
* Adults have prior experiences that are rich resources for learning. The adult learner integrates new learning into what they already know.
* Adults appreciate the application of theory ‘in the real world’.
* Adults are responsible for their own learning and exhibit behaviors of an individual ready and wanting to learn.
* As an expert in the field, the instructor is a facilitator of learning – not a ‘sage on the stage’ but a ‘guide on the side’.
* Assignments are designed to challenge the learner, build upon concepts and encourage reflection on experience.
* Adults collaborate and support one another in their learning rather than compete. Everyone is capable of doing well.
* Self-reflection, dialogue, writing and collaborative small group work are essential in sense-making and learning. Rote memory and lecture are deemphasized.


### Prior Needs Assessment
![](image-5.jpeg)

Before you plan to teach anything, it’s a good idea to find out what your students already know.  You can save time (and boredom) by not spending time on topics or skills that they already know and instead plan to enhance their knowledge and take them further.  This is a much more motivating approach and one that adults will appreciate.  A prior needs assessment is not always a "quiz" though – it can be a discussion, a concept map, a KWL (Know, Want to Know, Learned), a ‘Minute Paper’…..The idea is to plan a way to learn what the participants already know on
the topic. Because they are adults it’s important to recognize their prior life experience.


### Learning with the Senses
![](image-2.jpeg)

Rather than planning a class based on the traditional lecture and PowerPoint, explore social-emotional learning and sensory-engaging pedagogies.  How can we incorporate the senses of sight, sound, smell, taste and touch into our teaching?

Examples of sensory-engaged teaching methods:

* Auditory input such as recorded video lectures; incorporation of music
* Visuals - analysis of videos and film; incorporation of art
* Problem-solving through case studies
* Storytelling
* Place-based learning including learning in nature and other environments
* Kinesthetic or movement learning activities eg role play
* Activities that incorporate the olfactory (sense of smell) eg. bringing in spices from a region to evoke the culture of food
* Activities that incorporate the sense of touch - textured materials, manipulatives
* Discussion forums
* Use of interactive technology


### Active Learning
![](image-3.jpeg)

The heart and soul of teaching well is designing, sequencing and planning active learning opportunities around engaging and compelling content. This is creative work that requires the educator to research solid content aligned with the learning objectives and discern effective means of sharing and engaging learners with that content. Furthermore, it requires the educator to think about their specific learners, their prior knowledge about the topic, any fears or resistance they may bring to the topic and then carefully craft the time allotted so that objectives can be met in a fair, reasonably-paced, anxiety-free and hopefully enjoyable manner. It is tempting to try to use many fun activities during a session, but it’s very important to be judicious in selecting activities that serve a learning purpose. Avoid the trap of many beginning educators who focus more on ‘activitizing’ rather than aligning learning opportunities to objectives and assessment.

Here are some classroom activities that you could use in your sessions: discussions, partner/group assignments, role plays, vocabulary practice, study skills, online course help, videos, etc.

**Class Discussions**

Facilitating discussion is a key skill of the adult educator and giving voice to the adult learner is one of the most important aspects for an adult educator to consider. Getting learners involved in the topic and having the confidence to speak in class and share their ideas whether through discussions or presentations, are essential elements of adult education.

**Promoting Critical Thinking**

Here are some examples of how to use the elements of critical thinking when designing activities:
•	Ask good questions – take your specific objectives for the lesson and create questions using the elements as prompts.
•	Group discussion – give students the elements and ask them to use them to analyze a reading or video.
•	Teach how to come up with a thesis statement using the elements. Take the topic and go around the circle asking each participant to create a statement from one of the prompts associated with the elements. At the end, you will end up with as many statements as there are participants. Help students work with the statements, combining them etc. to make their thesis statement. This process facilitates sharp thinking and helps to focus students.
•	Use the elements as an outline to help students writing in a more disciplined way about a topic.


With those in mind, below are some active learning strategies you may want to incorporate into your lessons.

Choose one of the readings for a unit and ask students to:

a) read while walking

b) read aloud

c) read aloud while walking outside

d) draw a picture or graphic of the information

e) ask, "What is the effect of these sensory additions to your reading?"


### Experiential Learning
![](image-6.jpeg)

Corporate trainer, Dave Root defines experiential learning as "immersive activities that mimic real-world challenges with a targeted debrief that connects the lessons learned with the reality of the workplace. It allows participants to learn by doing."  Some examples of experiential learning include cooperative education, practicums, internships, studies abroad, field trips, service learning projects, role playing, case studies and simulations. For excellent examples and best practices in experiential learning, be sure to read this article from Ryerson University's Learning and Teaching Office.

>> Chapman et al. have provided a list of characteristics that should be present in order to define an activity or method as experiential. These characteristics include:
1. *Mixture of content and process:* There must be a balance between the experiential activities and the
underlying content or theory.
2. *Absence of excessive judgment:* The instructor must create a safe space for students to work through
their own process of self-discovery.
3. *Engagement in purposeful endeavors:* In experiential learning, the learner is the self-teacher,
therefore there must be “meaning for the student in the learning.” The learning activities must be
personally relevant to the student.
4. *Encouraging the big picture perspective:* Experiential activities must allow the students to make
connections between the learning they are doing and the world. Activities should build in students the
ability see relationships in complex systems and find a way to work within them.
5. *The role of reflection:* Students should be able to reflect on their own learning, bringing “the theory to
life” and gaining insight into themselves and their interactions with the world.
6. *Creating emotional investment:* Students must be fully immersed in the experience, not merely doing
what they feel is required of them. The “process needs to engage the learner to a point where what is
being learned and experience strikes a critical, central chord within the learner.”
7. *The re-examination of values:* By working within a space that has been made safe for self-exploration, students can begin to analyze and even alter their own values.
8. *The presence of meaningful relationships:* One part of getting students to see their learning in the
context of the whole world is to start by showing the relationships between “learner to self, learner to
teacher, and learner to learning environment.”
9. *Learning outside one’s perceived comfort zones:* “Learning is enhanced when students are given the
opportunity to operate outside of their own perceived comfort zones.” This doesn’t refer just to
physical environment, but also to the social environment. This could include, for instance, “being
accountable for one’s actions and owning the consequences” (Chapman, McPhee, & Proudman, 1995,
p. 243).


### Icebreakers in the Classroom


Icebreakers are usually short activities that precede the main activity in a
classroom or any meeting, with the sole aim of warming up the meeting.
Icebreakers need to be properly planned and implemented otherwise they may break
or mar an event. Icebreakers should be

-   easy to do

-   not be boring

-   should not be long

-   should be engaging

There are several examples of activities that may be used as icebreakers.

Here is where we'll mention the layout and features of most FAR Centre courses (e.g. units, learning activities, assessments, etc.)

The online courses will be accessible through Moodle, TWU’s online course database. They will be designed similarly to traditional online courses, but the design also considers the role of the face-to-face facilitator. Each course will be divided into units and lessons, and there will be a corresponding facilitator’s guide for each course that outlines how the facilitator can plan the learning labs in accordance with the course material. Working overseas, the facilitator will be responsible for keeping in close contact with the instructor via email or ZOOM(similar to skype). It will be important for facilitators to read through the guide early enough to leave time to ask any necessary questions to the instructor.

It is also important that the facilitator takes time in the learning labs to teach the students how to use Moodle or any other online resources. Depending on where you are going, students may be unfamiliar with these technological platforms and therefore need help troubleshooting how to navigate the course page. Just because North American students may be familiar with working in online formats, it is best to take the time to explain the process at the beginning of the course.

[details="Setting up your Schedule"]

![](image-70.jpeg)

Each FAR center will have a different schedule for different sets of courses they are offering. However, it will be important for you as a facilitator to understand the expectations of you once you arrive on your FAR Center campus. You will be required to lead Learning Labs for each course that run for about 3 hours, once or twice a week. During these labs, you will facilitate activities that correspond with the facilitation guides provided by the instructor, but as you get to know the students, you will know how to design your learning labs. If times correspond, you may want to see I you can have the instructor zoom in once or twice in the semester for introductions and so the students have a reference for who their instructor is. If this isn’t possible, you can use pre-recorded videos of the instructor to watch during the labs.

The learning labs will be for group activities, but a part from those assigned times, you will want to create space in your schedule to be your designated “office hours” where students can drop by if they need one-on-one. Some students may need extra assistance and you can use this time to look over individual assignments and learn more in-depth about who they are.

When setting up your schedule, you will need to consider some of the following things:

* Learning labs- between 6-10 hours a week
* Coaching sessions- 30 min-1 hour session for each students
* Lesson Planning + Coach prepping- About 5-10 hours a week
* Connecting with FAR centre team (faculty, project manager etc.): 4-6 hours a week
* Homework for Graduate Certificate: 10 hours a week
