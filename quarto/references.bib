  abstract = {Happiness, well-being, human freedom, and life events are interconnected. Nevertheless, the debate about human well-being struggles to find an exact definition. Literature debates on the importance of positive psychology or adverse effects of negative psychology in the well-being context discuss separately. However, both counter each other but have their significance and indisputable fact. Human psychology evolves around determinism and Free Will. One type of determinism is hard, while the other is soft. Individuals who are adamant about and embrace acceptance of chances are driven by their nature and psychology to choose negative behaviors under hard determinism. They give up their free will, whereas soft determinists use it to make choices and behave positively. However, the researchers looked at negative psychology as a useful aspect and positive psychology's dark side. We argued that there are reasons to suppose that chances can develop into options and vice versa. From a well-being perspective, negative and positive psychological strengths and weaknesses can be investigated. From the literature review, useful hypotheses for future research have been derived from our synthesis.},

Methods We convened nine focus groups in three Canadian cities in 2002 and 2004 in conjunction with a national public opinion telephone survey of Canadians' attitudes and values toward their health system. Health system trust emerged as a significant theme in focus group discussions and was investigated using a modified grounded theory approach. Findings Respondents construct cleavages and alliances to position themselves in relation to different features of the trusted health system. The health system and Canadian Medicare are identified sources of trust just as are individual health care providers. Core to the trust relationship is the experience of vulnerability which provides the impetus for placing trust (in providers, governments and health systems) or seeds distrust, mistrust and resilience in the same. Conclusions We offer a more robust conceptualization of what it means to trust a health system. Policy maker efforts to intervene to restore lost trust could usefully be informed by these findings.},

This article describes an ongoing meta-analysis that summarizes the available empirical evidence on the impact of instruction on the development and enhancement of critical thinking skills and dispositions. We found 117 studies based on 20,698 participants, which yielded 161 effects with an average effect size (g+) of 0.341 and a standard deviation of 0.610. The distribution was highly heterogeneous (QT = 1,767.86, p {$<$} .001). There was, however, little variation due to research design, so we neither separated studies according to their methodological quality nor used any statistical adjustment for the corresponding effect sizes. Type of CT intervention and pedagogical grounding were substantially related to fluctuations in CT effects sizes, together accounting for 32\% of the variance. These findings make it clear that improvement in students' CT skills and dispositions cannot be a matter of implicit expectation. As important as the development of CT skills is considered to be, educators must take steps to make CT objectives explicit in courses and also to include them in both preservice and in-service training and faculty development.},

Sowell was born in segregated Gastonia, North Carolina, to a poor family, and grew up in Harlem, New York City. Due to poverty and difficulties at home, he dropped out of Stuyvesant High School and worked various odd jobs, eventually serving in the United States Marine Corps during the Korean War. Afterward he took night classes at Howard University and then attended Harvard University, where he graduated magna cum laude in 1958. He earned a master's degree in economics from Columbia University the next year and a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago in 1968. In his academic career, he has served on the faculties of Cornell University, Amherst College, Brandeis University, the University of California, Los Angeles, and, currently, Stanford University. He has also worked at think tanks including the Urban Institute. Since 1977, he has worked at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, where he is the Rose and Milton Friedman Senior Fellow on Public Policy.

  abstract = {This paper offers a critical and theoretical exploration of the contemporary use of standards in assessment in higher education. It outlines three discourses of assessment standards. Each perspective foregrounds particular realities and backgrounds others, and so influences practice in particular taken-for-granted ways. The assumptions of these perspectives are identified, and the advantages and disadvantages of each of the existing discourses discussed. The dominant perspective prompts educators to make standards `transparent' for students, inferring stability through a written explication. The sociocultural perspective highlights a tacit and more dynamic view of standards, suggesting that standards are built by expert consensus and students must learn to meet this community expectation. The sociomaterial perspective also infers a dynamic view, but one that is co-produced through social and material assemblages. Thinking about standards as performance, a dynamic and shifting human-material activity, encourages a focus on emergent activity in the design of standards, moderation and assessment.

Once I was introduced to me, it was important that I formulate the best romance ever and find a way to give to myself what I had been responsible for giving to others all of my life, hope. Once I learned how to give it to me and always keep just enough to give to another woman, my sisters, my eyes and ears. I began living a life with a purpose. It's the best love story ever. Telling my everyday story may inspire someone to share that she needs help with addiction, or give someone the freedom to share that she too is living a life of recovery.

We developed a social          media intervention, in design-based research terms, that allows these independent          students to contribute archived content to enhance the course, to engage in discussions          with other students and to share as little or as much personal information with each          other as they wished. We describe the learning design for the intervention and present          survey data of student and tutor perception of value and content analysis of the archived          contributions. The results indicate that the intervention was positively received          by tutors and by the majority (but not all) students and that the archive created          by the students' contributions was adding value to the course. We conclude that the          intervention was a modest, yet manageable example of a learning enhancement to a traditional          cognitive-behavioral, course that has positive impact and potential with little negative          impact on workload.},

They share those lessons in this book, along with stories of successful practice and practical tools ready for immediate classroom application. The authors also provide opportunities for reflection and closure designed to help you consider (or reconsider) your current beliefs and practices.

Six studies using adolescents, university students, and adults measured the associations among the self-importance of moral identity, moral cognitions, and behavior. The psychometric properties of the measure were assessed through an examination of the underlying factor structure (Study 1) and convergent, nomological, and discriminant validity analyses (Studies 2 and 3). The predictive validity of the instrument was assessed by examinations of the relationships among the self-importance of moral identity, various psychological outcomes, and behavior (Studies 4, 5, and 6). The results are discussed in terms of models of moral behavior, social identity measurement, and the need to consider moral self-conceptions in explaining moral conduct.

We distinguish between different types of scoping studies and indicate where these stand in relation to full systematic reviews. We outline a framework for conducting a scoping study based on our recent experiences of reviewing the literature on services for carers for people with mental health problems. Where appropriate, our approach to scoping the field is contrasted with the procedures followed in systematic reviews. We emphasize how including a consultation exercise in this sort of study may enhance the results, making them more useful to policy makers, practitioners and service users. Finally, we consider the advantages and limitations of the approach and suggest that a wider debate is called for about the role of the scoping study in relation to other types of literature reviews.},

  abstract = {Illness creates a range of negative emotions in patients including anxiety, fear, powerlessness, and vulnerability. There is much debate on the 'therapeutic' or 'helping' nurse-patient relationship. However, despite the current agenda regarding patient-centred care, the literature concerning the development of good interpersonal responses and the view that a satisfactory nursing ethics should focus on persons and character traits rather than actions, nursing ethics is dominated by the traditional obligation, act-centred theories such as consequentialism and deontology. I critically examine these theories and the role of duty-based notions in both general ethics and nursing practice. Because of well-established flaws, I conclude that obligation-based moral theories are incomplete and inadequate for nursing practice. I examine the work of Hursthouse on virtue ethics' action guidance and the v-rules. I argue that the moral virtues and a strong (action-guiding) version of virtue ethics provide a plausible and viable alternative for nursing practice. I develop an account of a virtue-based helping relationship and a virtue-based approach to nursing. The latter is characterized by three features: (1) exercising the moral virtues such as compassion; (2) using judgement; and (3) using moral wisdom, understood to include at least moral perception, moral sensitivity, and moral imagination. Merits and problems of the virtue-based approach are examined. I relate the work of MacIntyre to nursing and I conceive nursing as a practice: nurses who exercise the virtues and seek the internal goods help to sustain the practice of nursing and thus prevent the marginalization of the virtues. The strong practice-based version of virtue ethics proposed is context-dependent, particularist, and relational. Several areas for future philosophical inquiry and empirical nursing research are suggested to develop this account yet further.},

The email comes from a generic domain. For example, gmail.com, yahoo.com, or hotmail.com instead of a company's official domain (like ``paypal.com'') 2. An urgent or threatening tone. For example, ``someone has hacked your account'' or ``you'll owe money if you don't act now!'' 3. A too-good-to-be-true offer. For example, an email that claims you've won ``free'' money or a sweepstakes you never entered. 4. Scam emails about missed package deliveries. For example, an email claiming to be from UPS asking you to ``update your shipping information'' 5. Suspicious or unexpected links. Scammers use links to send you to phishing sites or even get you to unknowingly download malware onto your device.  6. Unsuspected domain names. After clicking on a link, check the URL of the page you were sent to. It should match the site you were expecting to visit.  7. Poor spelling and grammar errors. Scammers often make basic language mistakes. A major company or government agency would never send emails full of spelling mistakes.  8. Strange attachments. Fraudsters will hide malware as ``invoices'' or other attachments in emails.  Want to stay safe from scammers? Sign up for Aura! With Aura, you get industry-leading identity theft protection for your entire family, constant credit monitoring, phishing and malware protection, 24/7 support from fraud resolution specialists, and \$1,000,000 in insurance for eligible losses due to identity theft.

In a Canadian hermeneutic phenomenological study, physicians, nurses, psychologists and non-professional aides were asked to identify care situations that they found morally distressing, and to elaborate on how moral concerns regarding the care of patients were raised and resolved. In this paper, we describe the experience of moral distress related by nurses working in mental healthcare settings who believed that lack of resources (such as time and staff) leads to dispiritedness, lack of respect, and absence of recognition (for both patients and staff) which severely diminished their ability to provide quality care. The metaphors of flashlight and hammer are used to elaborate nurses' possible responses to intolerable situations.},

We describe in this introduction to the special issue current thinking in this emerging field of research as well as questions and concerns. We begin by considering some of the environmental and organizational forces that may have triggered interest in describing and studying authentic leadership and its development. We then provide an overview of its contents, including the diverse theoretical and methodological perspectives presented, followed by a discussion of alternative conceptual foundations and definitions for the constructs of authenticity, authentic leaders, authentic leadership, and authentic leadership development. A detailed description of the components of authentic leadership theory is provided next. The similarities and defining features of authentic leadership theory in comparison to transformational, charismatic, servant and spiritual leadership perspectives are subsequently examined. We conclude by discussing the status of authentic leadership theory with respect to its purpose, construct definitions, historical foundations, consideration of context, relational/processual focus, attention to levels of analysis and temporality, along with a discussion of promising directions for future research.},

He talks about common behaviours (addictions, self-harm, acting out) that some people engage in when attempting to regulate the emotional dysregulation caused by BPD. He addresses the reasons that BPD symptoms may develop for an individual and refers to three evidence based treatments: Dialectic Behavioural Therapy (DBT), Mentalisation and Schema Therapy. Dr. Gaynor also stresses the important contribution made by Margaret Linehan, who is considered the leading expert internationally in the field of BPD.}

  abstract = {This paper aims to undertake a content analysis of extant definitions of ``innovation'' as a basis for proposing an integrative definition of organizational ``innovation''.A literature review was used to generate a representative pool of definitions of organizational innovation, including definitions from the different disciplinary literatures of economics, innovation and entrepreneurship, business and management, and technology, science and engineering. A content analysis of these definitions was conducted in order to surface the key attributes mentioned in the definitions, and to profile the descriptors used in relation to each attribute.The key attributes in the paper present in definitions were identified as: nature of innovation; type of innovation; stages of innovation, social context; means of innovation; and aim of innovation. These attributes are defined, descriptors assigned to them, and both a diagrammatic definition and a textual definition of organizational innovation are proposed.As a concept that is owned and discussed by many business disciplines, ``innovation'' has many different definitions that align with the dominant paradigm of the respective disciplines. Building on these diverse definitions, this paper proposes a general and integrative definition of organizational ``innovation'' that encompasses the different perspectives on, and aspects of, innovation, and captures its essence.},

Recent research highlights the need for the overall study of graduate student use of the library and of those services and resources geared toward that population. A University of Iowa Libraries' user needs assessment survey of a random sample of graduate and professional students revealed that although graduate and professional students come to the library to do research or to use other library resources, fewer come to study or borrow books. Graduate and professional students recognize the need for more assistance in using the library and would like more opportunities for library instruction. They prefer human contact. Even though they are satisfied with the resources and quality of staff assistance, they would like to find more material on the shelves when they need them. In addition, many of them are unaware of the range of library services available to them. One of the key strategic goals of the University of Iowa is the maintenance and support of premier graduate and professional programs. Among 131 public research universities recently ranked in Hugh Davis Graham's and Nancy Diamond's 1997 book The Rise of the American Research Universities, the University of Iowa ranked among the top 20 based on the quantity and quality of research performance (1997).  As one of only two public research universities in the state of Iowa,  the University of Iowa has a special role in graduate and professional  education. In the knowledge-intensive world of the future, graduate  and professional education play a central role, and given the limited  opportunities for such education within the state of Iowa, this part of  the University of Iowa's mission will increase in importance over time.}

  year = 1985,

  address = {New York : London},
  abstract = {Why do most leaders or managers elicit merely competent performance from their followers, while a select few inspire extraordinary achievement? Leadership expert Bernard Bass takes this question beyond the usual speculation, presenting original research that for the first time documents the traits of the exceptional leader.  For half a century, leadership studies have focused primarily on "transactional" leaders: those who provide well-defined rewards to their followers -- whether they be office employees, community volunteers, or infantry soldiers -- for well-defined services. Because they are harder to study and measure, "transformational" -- or charismatic -- leaders have been largely ignored. Until now. Leadership and Performance Beyond Expectations represents a major breakthrough in our understanding of who these leaders are, how they get results, and why their leadership often exceeds all expectable limits.  In its most complete summary to date, Bass reviews the theory and research on transformational leadership. He closes the gap between the work of social and organizational psychologists, whose focus has been on small groups and institutional settings, and that of political scientists and psychohistorians, who have done most of the important studies of world-class leaders.  To these previous studies Bass adds his own crucial findings. He shows that charisma is not a rare phenomenon -- many of us are blessed with it in varying degrees -- and he suggests ways to identify and encourage it in corporate, educational, governmental, and military settings.  Bass also provides an important Leadership Questionnaire for measuring both transactional and transformational traits -- a tool that is sure to become heavily used for individual self-appraisal and personnel evaluations in a variety of organizations. And he presents numerous examples of real-life transformationalists, including Thomas J. Watson of IBM, Lee Iacocca of Chrysler, Steven Jobs of Apple Computer, George F. Johnson of Endicott-Johnson, and such historic nonbusiness leaders as Jane Addams of Hull House, General George S. Patton of the U.S. Third Army, and Robert Hutchins of the University of Chicago.  Not all charismatic figures are born leaders; some can be nurtured in organizational contexts. Tracing the interrelated effects of personality and environment on leadership, Leadership and Performance Beyond Expectations will change ideas about what a leader is at both the personal and institutional level. It is bound to alter the course of leadership research for the next decade.},

  abstract = {The culmination of a long-standing research effort by the author, this book provides the reader with a portion of the research and development that has been completed about transformational leadership. In less than 20 years, the subject has caught the attention of scholars, students, and practicing leaders. Although the book draws heavily from military research, findings in business organizations, educational institutions, government agencies, and hospitals are not ignored because the principles of transformational leadership have considerable generality. Situational differences are discussed and a general model of transformational and transactional leadership describing the consequences is presented. In a nutshell, the author shows that transformational leadership is more effective and satisfying than constructive transactions, and constructive transactions are more effective and satisfying than corrective ones. Passive leadership is least effective and satisfying. Leaders use all these approaches but some do more than others in how they lead. Better leaders are transformational more frequently; less adequate leaders concentrate on correction and passivity.Transformational Leadership, Second Edition is intended for both the scholars and serious students of leadership. It is a comprehensive review of theorizing and empirical research that can serve as a reference and starting point for additional research on the theory. It can be used as a supplementary textbook in an intense course on leadership--or as a primary text in a course or seminar focusing on transformational leadership.New in the Second Edition:*New, updated examples of leadership have been included to help illustrate the concepts, as well as show the broad range of transformational leadership in a variety of settings.*New chapters have been added focusing specifically on the measurement of transformational leadership and transformational leadership and effectiveness.*The discussion of both predicators and effects of transformational leadership is greatly expanded.*Much more emphasis is given to authentic vs. inauthentic transformational leadership.*Suggestions are made for guiding the future of research and applications of transformational leadership.*A greatly expanded reference list is included.},

  abstract = {There are dissonances between educators' aspirations for assessment design and actual assessment implementation in higher education. Understanding how assessment is designed `on the ground' can assist in resolving this tension. Thirty-three Australian university educators from a mix of disciplines and institutions were interviewed. A thematic analysis of the transcripts indicated that assessment design begins as a response to an impetus for change. The design process itself was shaped by environmental influences, which are the circumstances surrounding the assessment design, and professional influences, which are those factors that the educators themselves bring to the process. A range of activities or tasks were undertaken, including those which were essential to all assessment design; those more selective activities, which educators chose to optimise the assessment process in particular ways; and meta-design processes which educators used to dynamically respond to environmental influences. The qualitative description indicates the complex social nature of interwoven personal and environmental influences on assessment design and the value of an explicit and strategic ways of thinking within the constraints and affordances of a local environment. This suggests that focussing on relational forms of professional development that develop strategic approaches to assessment may be beneficial. The role of disciplinary approaches may be significant and remains an area for future research.},

There are clear comparisons to be made between this movement and earlier ones that have embraced both individualism and an ethos of adjustment, such as the popular mind cures of the late 19th century and the influential mental hygiene movement of the early 20th century. We argue for a focus beyond the individual in isolation, a perspective that takes in the totality of the social environment and an ethical stance that values social engagement and activism. We further call for more nuanced conceptions of happiness, virtue, and strengths, as well as for more socially informed theorizing about human flourishing. Finally, we suggest that positive psychology, with its growing assortment of applied uses, serves to address the acute market pressures facing clinical psychologists today.

The advent of trauma-informed care has been important but has limitations that obfuscate social and structural determinants of health, equity, and social justice. As forensic nursing practice becomes more complex, narrow definitions of violence and trauma limit the effectiveness of trauma-informed care in its current incarnation. In keeping with the nursing model of holistic care, we need ways to teach, practice, and conduct research that can accommodate these increasing levels of complexity, including expanding our conceptualizations of violence and trauma to advance health equity and social justice. The objective of this article is to introduce the concepts of structural violence and trauma- and violence-informed care as equity-oriented critical paradigms to embrace the increasing complexity and health inequities facing forensic nursing practice.},

The following recommendations are made: (1) statistical significance should not be the only criterion for instructors to consider when choosing new teaching methods; (2) multiple test measures, including quantitative and qualitative, should be used to assess changes in students' critical thinking skills; (3) future research should properly address internal validity threats, e.g. by adopting at least a quasi-experimental design, in order to establish causal relationship between intervention and changes in students' critical thinking skills.},

  abstract = {Jacqueline Fawcett's nursing metaparadigm-the domains of person, health, environment, and nursing-remains popular in nursing curricula, despite having been repeatedly challenged as a logical philosophy of nursing. Fawcett appropriated the word "metaparadigm" (indirectly) from Margaret Masterman and Thomas Kuhn as a devise that allowed her to organize then-current areas of nursing interest into a philosophical "hierarchy of knowledge," and thereby claim nursing inquiry and practice as rigorously "scientific." Scholars have consistently rejected the logic of Fawcett's metaparadigm, but have not yet proposed a substantially agreed-upon alternative. Through an analysis of articles introducing and critiquing Fawcett's metaparadigm, I argue for a re-conceptualized metaparadigm that articulates nursing's ontology. What exists for the nursing discipline are not already-demarcated metaparadigm domains, but rather interdependent, dynamic relations that constitute people, including nurses, in their health/environment circumstance. The nursing discipline aims to skillfully access this dynamic relationality as the basis for action and reflection to produce both positive health trajectories and knowledge that facilitates future action and reflection. Further inquiry into the onto-epistemology of nursing will produce a more robust understanding of nursing practice, science, and philosophy, and clarify its unique contribution to health and healthcare.},

Using mixed research methods, we qualitatively identify the characteristics of status conflicts, validate a four-item survey scale that distinctly measures status conflict, and investigate the relationship between status conflict and group performance. We determine that status conflict exerts a significant negative main effect, moderates the effects of task conflict on group performance, and hurts performance by undermining information sharing more than other types of conflict do.},

  abstract = {This paper examines how a producer's status in the market influences its choices about product quality, and the outcomes that result. We compare economic models of reputation that emphasize the role of past quality as a source of information about current quality with sociological models of status that emphasize the role of affiliations. We test hypotheses about the complementary effects of status and reputation in an analysis of more than 10,000 affiliation decisions made by 595 wineries over a 10-year period. Results show that actors occupying high-status positions obtain greater benefit from subsequent high-status affiliations than do actors occupying low-status positions. As such, these actors are more willing and able to pay for subsequent high-status affiliations and to use them to advance their position in the larger status ordering.},

Each of these 51 chapters and 3 leadership vignettes presents an examination of the state of the science behind quality and safety concepts and challenges the reader to not only use evidence to change practices but also to actively engage in developing the evidence base to address critical knowledge gaps. Patient safety and quality care are at the core of health care systems and processes and are inherently dependent upon nurses. To achieve goals in patient safety and quality, and thereby improve health care throughout this nation, nurses must assume the leadership role.},

Following a chapter on the foreign ministry, Part I of this book deals with the art of negotiation (prenegotiations, around-the-table negotiations, diplomatic momentum, packaging agreements, and following up); Part II covers conventional modes of diplomacy (embassies, telecommunications, consulates, secret intelligence by `legals', conferences, summits, and public diplomacy); and Part III examines diplomacy in hostile circumstances (embassy substitutes such as representative offices and interests sections, special missions, and mediation). Students and educators of diplomacy will find much of value in the latest edition of this highly regarded and much-cited textbook. G. R. Berridge is Emeritus Professor of International Politics at the University of Leicester, UK, sometime Occasional Teacher at the London School of Economics \& Political Science, and a Senior Fellow of DiploFoundation.

He is the author of eleven books, including five national bestsellers: Three Blind Mice: How the TV Networks Lost Their Way; Greed And Glory On Wall Street: The Fall of The House of Lehman; The Highwaymen: Warriors of the Information Super Highway; World War 3.0: Microsoft and Its Enemies; and Googled, The End of the World As We Know It, which was published in November of 2009. His other books include: Backstory: Inside the Business of News; Media Man: Ted Turner's Improbable Empire; The Streets Were Paved with Gold; and The Underclass. Auletta was among the first to popularize the so-called information superhighway with his February, 1993, profile of Barry Diller's search for something new. He has profiled the leading figures and companies of the Information Age, including Google, Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch, AOL Time Warner, John Malone, Harvey Weinstein, and the New York Times; he has dissected media meteors that fell to earth like "push" technology and inter-active TV, probed media violence, the PAC giving of communication giants, the fat lecture fees earned by journalist/pundits, and explored what "synergy" may mean to journalism. His 2001 profile of Ted Turner won a National Magazine Award as the best profile of the year. He covered the Microsoft antitrust trial for the magazine. In ranking him as America's premier media critic, the Columbia Journalism Review concluded, "no other reporter has covered the new communications revolution as thoroughly as has Auletta." New York Magazine described him as the "media Boswell." In another life, Auletta taught and trained Peace Corps volunteers; served as Special Assistant to the U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce; worked in Senator Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 campaign for the Presidency; and was Executive Editor of the weekly Manhattan Tribune.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TRANSCRIPT: Ken Auletta: Netflix in the early days -- we're talking about the late 1990s -- was terrified that it was gonna go out of business.  They were mailing DVDs and it was very expensive to do that so they weren't making any money.  And Blockbuster was this colossus and so Reed Hastings, the founder of Netflix, gets on an airplane and goes to Dallas to try and convince Blockbuster to come together and partner in some way.  Ultimately what he really wanted to do was for Blockbuster to buy Netflix and for Netflix to be their long range online arm because he knew one day he would be delivering television, or video over the Internet.  And Blockbuster could have its stores but he thought the stores would be in decline as, in fact, happened. Blockbuster in retrospect stupidly declined to invest in Netflix. And within a couple of years Netflix had basically helped destroy Blockbuster.  Blockbuster was an old technology.  You went to a video store to rent a video.  Most of the top 20 movies were already out of stock because people had rented them so there's a lot frustration.  And Netflix was basically, you know, get what you want when you want it and knew that they would move away from the DVD business to the download video business.  So you could watch as many, you know, you could never run out of stock. I think it's very accurate to compare Netflix to a book and I think that's part of the forward vision that Hastings had.  If you think about the way -- what Netflix has done with what has come to be called bingeing, it basically replicates a book because it basically says you want to watch House of Cards or Orange is the New Black, you don't have to wait and watch it at ten o'clock on Friday nights or eight o'clock on Thursday nights.  You can watch it whenever you want.  And, by the way, you don't have to watch commercials. And, by the way, which means the show is longer.  And, by the way, you don't have to watch a single episode, you can watch multiple episodes.  Watch it as long as you want.  Eat as much as you want.  Just as when you read a book.  You want to read more than chapter, you read more than one chapter. So the analogy is apt and I think he was smart about that. Read the full transcript at https://bigthink.com/videos/how-netfl...},

The author of ``The Body Keeps the Score'' explains, with Bessel van der Kolk Subscribe to Big Think on YouTube ►► ~~~/~@bigthink~~ Up next ►► How to heal trauma with meaning: A case study in emotional evolution {\textbar} BJ Miller https://www.youtube.com/c/bigthink/se... Contrary to popular belief, trauma is extremely common. We all have jobs, life events, and unpleasant situations causing us daily stress. But when your body continues to re-live that stress for days, weeks, months, or even years, that stress changes your brain, creating trauma inside your mind, and that trauma can eventually manifest in your physical body.  As you can see, trauma isn't what happens to you, but how you respond to the traumatic situation. Something that is traumatic to one person may be no big deal to the next. Whether something becomes traumatic or not has a great deal to do with who's around you while you experience this event. Were you alone and scared, were you comforted by friends and family? The problem with trauma is that it starts when something happens to us, but that's not where it stops - it changes your brain. Once your brain changes and you're in constant fight or flight mode, it can be hard to stay focused, feel joy, or experience pleasure until this trauma is healed. Luckily, modern psychological practices are developing innovative ways to heal from trauma that actually work.

His work focuses on the interaction of attachment, neurobiology, and developmental aspects of trauma's effects on people. His major publication, Traumatic Stress: The Effects of Overwhelming Experience on Mind, Body, and Society, talks about how the role of trauma in psychiatric illness has changed over the past 20 years. Dr. van der Kolk is past President of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies, Professor of Psychiatry at Boston University Medical School, and Medical Director of the Trauma Center at JRI in Brookline, Massachusetts. He has taught at universities and hospitals across the United States and around the world, including Europe, Africa, Russia, Australia, Israel, and China.

No longer can students look forward to middle class success in the conduct of manual labor or use of routine skills -- work that can be accomplished by machines. Rather, whether a technician or a professional person, success lies in being able to communicate, share, and use information to solve complex problems, in being able to adapt and innovate in response to new demands and changing circumstances, in being able to marshal and expand the power of technology to create new knowledge, and in expanding human capacity and productivity.},

In this paper, an attempt was made to verify their usability in that sense. Two Encyclicals from the Catholic Fond of the Birta Archives were separated and it was examined, through comparative analysis, to what extent these Encyclicals were useful for checking historical data about on which there are doubts, and to what extent they can offer new, not yet known and important information. Thereby of course, all limitations of such data and its adequate contextualization are taken into account. These are the Encyclicals in which the Pope urges local bishops to check the allegations in the request of the Naples nobles who want to marry, even though they are close relatives. Since other original documents on the studied topic are currently unavailable, and the material has not been sorted, integrated and published in the print form, the scope of the Papal Encyclicals as sources was checked by comparing it with publicly available digitized databases and internet presentations and encyclopedias.},

They set out prepared to chart a waterway to the Pacific Ocean, only to find themselves face-to-face with the Rocky Mountains. In many ways, leadership today feels much the same. You may find yourself navigating an unfamiliar cultural landscape, leading in contexts you never anticipated. Perhaps the skills and training you once relied on feel inadequate for the journey ahead, holding you back more often than propelling you forward. Drawing from his extensive experience as a pastor and consultant, Tod Bolsinger brings decades of expertise in guiding churches and organizations through uncharted territory. In Canoeing the Mountains, Bolsinger provides a thoughtful and practical guide for leaders facing the unprecedented challenges of a rapidly changing world. Canoeing the Mountains offers: Fresh perspectives on the adaptive leadership needed to face today's challenges Practical strategies to help you rethink your approach to leading in unfamiliar and shifting environments An expanded study guide to help you reflect, apply, and implement these lessons in your own leadership journey If you're ready to move beyond the tools that no longer serve you and embrace a new way of leading, Canoeing the Mountains will inspire and equip you to rise to the challenge. To scale the mountains of modern ministry, it's time to set aside your canoes and new navigational tools to give you confidence and courage to lead in places you never expected to find yourself.},

Tod Bolsinger, leadership expert and author of Canoeing the Mountains, is uniquely positioned to explore the qualities of adaptive leadership in contexts ranging from churches to nonprofit organizations. In Tempered Resilience, he deftly examines both the external challenges we face and the internal resistance that holds us back. Bolsinger writes:'To temper describes the process of heating, holding, hammering, cooling, and reheating that adds stress to raw iron until it becomes a glistening knife blade or chisel tip.'When reflection and relationships are combined into a life of deliberate practice, leaders become both stronger and more flexible. As a result, resilient leaders are able to offer greater wisdom and skill to those they serve, focusing on a vision that is beyond the profit, success, or even survival of the organization---one that is focused on the needs of real people. In Tempered Resilience, Bolsinger walks through the six-step process of how tempered leaders are formed: Working: Leaders are formed in leading. Heating: Strength is forged in self-reflection. Holding: Vulnerable leadership requires relational security. Hammering: Stress makes a leader. Hewing: Resilience takes practice. Tempering: Resilience comes through a rhythm of leading and not leading. If you're facing resistance to the changes you know are necessary for your organization to thrive in this rapidly changing world, Tempered Resilience will give you the tools you need to remain steadfast through change and lead with strength of purpose.

Fourth, much discourse concerning SoTL is anti-intellectual and located in a narrow neoliberalism. Fifth, there is uncritical over-reliance on peer review as the mechanism for measuring scholarship. Each impediment makes SoTL a hard sell -- particularly in research-intensive universities.

  abstract = {ENGLISH Can we be sure that assessment in higher education meets the need of developing and assuring high quality learning outcomes? Current assessment is typically a collection of conventional practices that have never been seriously questioned. Ten years ago, as part of a national project, representatives from Australian universities came together to identify an agenda for change in assessment. The resulting document---Assessment 2020: Seven propositions for assessment reform in higher education---focused on how assessment needed to change to support long term learning. That is, not how students can pass the next exam, but learning that is useful beyond the point of graduation. From a learning-centred view this paper examine progress on assessment reform in universities internationally from the perspective of one of the players. It starts by considering Assessment 2020 to see where action is still needed. It reviews some of the major shifts in assessment in higher education and considers their implications. These include the move from comparing students (norm-referencing) to judging outcomes against standards (standards-based); and importantly, the conceptual shift from the single purpose of assessment as certifying students to multiple purposes including aiding learning and building the capacity of students to make their own judgements. Espanol {\textquestiondown}Podemos estar seguros de que la evaluaci{\'o}n en la educaci{\'o}n superior satisface la necesidad de desarrollar y garantizar resultados de aprendizaje de alta calidad? La evaluaci{\'o}n actual es t{\'i}picamente una colecci{\'o}n de pr{\'a}cticas convencionales que nunca han sido seriamente cuestionadas. Hace diez a{\~n}os, como parte de un proyecto nacional, representantes de universidades australianas se reunieron para identificar una agenda para el cambio en la evaluaci{\'o}n. El documento resultante Evaluaci{\'o}n 2020: siete propuestas para la reforma de la evaluaci{\'o}n en la educaci{\'o}n superior, se centr{\'o} en c{\'o}mo deb{\'i}a cambiar la evaluaci{\'o}n para apoyar el aprendizaje a lo largo de la vida.

Desde una perspectiva centrada en el aprendizaje, este documento analiza a nivel internacional el progreso que se ha producido en las universidades en torno a la reforma de la evaluaci{\'o}n desde la perspectiva de uno de sus actores. Se inicia considerando el documento Evaluaci{\'o}n 2020 para ver d{\'o}nde a{\'u}n se necesitan acciones.

(b) Effective supervision and evaluation are part of a career-long continuum of practice that fosters teacher growth while ensuring quality teaching. (c) There are multiple learning pathways to effective overall instructional leadership.

We outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.},

In the current study, disordered eating and body image were examined as risk factors for suicide ideation since these factors are prevalent in adolescence, particularly for females. It was hypothesized that disordered eating and body image, in addition to depressive symptoms, would contribute to suicide ideation. It was also hypothesized that these relationships would be stronger for females than for males. Structural equation modeling was used to test a model of risk for suicide ideation incorporating the above factors in a sample of 392 high school students. Results indicated that disordered eating contributed to both suicide ideation and depressive symptoms, while body image only contributed to depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms contributed to suicide ideation. The model was found to be cross-validated with males and females, and no gender differences emerged. Implications of these findings and their importance in constructing future models of adolescent suicide risk are discussed.},

  abstract = {Have you ever heard that the oldest kid in a family tends to be very responsible, while children who have no siblings are far more likely to be selfish and demanding? Are these merely stereotypes, or is it really true? Today, we've decided to find the answer to this intriguing question How Birth Order Can Shape Your Personality? The birth order theory began in the late 1920s with Alfred Adler, Sigmund Freud's friend, and colleague. Adler believed that the order in which you are born into a family inherently affects your personality. According to him, the oldest child, for example, tends to be conservative, power-oriented, and predisposed toward leadership. Do you think it's true? TIMESTAMPS:  The first-born child 0:38 The middle child 0:55 The youngest child 1:21 The only child 1:53 How birth order affects IQ scores 2:24 How birth order affects your personality 3:13 Is birth order really that important? 3:48 \#birthorder \#siblings \#yourpersonality SUMMARY: According to Alfred Adler, firstborns grow up to be caring, more willing to become parents, and more likely to take initiative. The middle kids in a family often tend to be ambitious, but they are rarely selfish. They are also more likely to set unreasonably high goals for themselves. Last-borns are usually highly motivated to surpass their older sisters and brothers. They achieve big success and earn recognition in their chosen field very often. Being overly pampered by their parents, the single kid expects pampering and protection from everyone around, too. Dependency and self-centeredness are the leading qualities of their lives. Older children generally show higher performance on intelligence tests. However, the scientists found no birth-order effects on emotional stability and imagination. Firstborns tend to be more honest and dominant. However, they are also less sociable and less resistant to stress. Middle children tend to be more conscientious and diligent. Birth order may have a certain impact on your personality or intelligence; however, don't forget that parent-child relationships and the upbringing that children receive in their homes are much more important factors in shaping their lives as individuals.

  abstract = {Negotiations can be fraught with emotion, but it's only recently that researchers have examined how particular feelings influence what happens during deal making. Here the author shares some key findings and advice. Anxiety leads to poor outcomes. You will be less nervous about negotiating, however, if you repeatedly practice and rehearse. You can also avoid anxiety by asking an outside expert to represent you at the bargaining table. Anger is a double-edged sword. In some cases, it intimidates the other parties and helps you strike a better deal, but in other situations, particularly those involving long-term relationships, it damages trust and goodwill and makes an impasse more likely. To avoid or defuse anger, take a break to cool off, or try expressing sadness and a desire to compromise. Disappointment can be channeled to reach a more satisfactory outcome. Before disappointment becomes regret, ask plenty of questions to assure yourself that you've explored all options. And don't close the deal too early; you might find ways to sweeten it if you keep talking. Excitement isn't always a good thing. Getting excited too early can lead you to act rashly, and gloating about the final terms can alienate your counterparts. But if feelings of excitement, like other emotions, are well managed, everyone can feel like a winner.},

As she maps the necessary skills and an actionable framework for meaningful connection, she gives us the language and tools to access a universe of new choices and second chances---a universe where we can share and steward the stories of our bravest and most heartbreaking moments with one another in a way that builds connection.~Over the past two decades, Brown's extensive research into the experiences that make us who we are has shaped the cultural conversation and helped define what it means to be courageous with our lives. Atlas of the Heart draws on this research, as well as on Brown's singular skills as a storyteller, to~show us how accurately naming an experience doesn't give the experience more power---it gives us the power of understanding, meaning, and choice.~Brown shares, ``I want this book to be an atlas for all of us, because I believe that, with an adventurous heart and the right maps, we can travel anywhere and never fear losing ourselves.''},

When the CSIRO released its Australian National Outlook 2019, it identified trust as one of the future key challenges the nation faces in relation to governments, business, non-government organisations, and the media. It is less likely that a company will be able to innovate and remain competitive if trust is low or absent. Prominent Australian educator Paul Browning faced this situation when the school he led became embroiled in The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. Principled draws on Browning's first-hand experience of navigating an organisation through this highly public ethical crisis and outlines the challenges he faced as a leader. Bringing together evidence-based research and over 20 years of management experience, Paul Browning offers timely advice on the 10 key practices that can help executives build and develop skills to become more trustworthy leaders.},

With the move within medical sciences education towards greater methodological rigor, it is now more important than ever for all educators to understand simply how to better approach their research via paradigms. In this monograph, a simplified approach to selecting an appropriate research paradigm is outlined. Suggestions are based on broad literature, medical education sources, and the author's own experiences in solidifying and communicating their research paradigms. By assisting in detailing the philosophical underpinnings of individuals research approaches, this guide aims to help all researchers improve the rigor of their projects and improve upon overall understanding in research communication.},

  abstract = {This case study details how and why integrating storytelling, empathy, and inclusive practice shifted QSuper, a large Australian finance organisation, from minimal awareness to moral awareness then moral capability in the delivery of services to Indigenous customers. During the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation, and Financial Services Industry, QSuper were recognised for their exemplary service with Indigenous customers (Hayne, Interim report: Royal commission into misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry, Volume 1. Commonwealth of Australia, 2018; Transcript of Proceedings, 13 August, Commonwealth of Australia, 2018). This position was in stark contrast to the inaccessible service offerings of other financial organisations where some used predatory practices to sell unethical financial products to Indigenous Australians (Hayne, Interim report: Royal commission into misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry, Volume 1. Commonwealth of Australia, 2018; Hayne, Final report: Royal commission into misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry, Volume 1. Commonwealth of Australia, 2019a). Storytelling garned from visiting customers in remote communities and other meaningful activities involving inclusive practice to facilitate ethical decision-making in finance is different to standard functionalist finance approaches (Schinckus, Int Rev Financ Anal 40:103--106, 2015). Two empathetic questions asked within QSuper complementing the storytelling, were: ``What is the right thing to do by the customer?'' and ``How would I feel if this were my mother?'' Exploration into the lived reality of moral capacity is important based on the Commission finding many of the 490,000 finance staff do not know how to provide ethical services to vulnerable customers, in particular remote Indigenous customers (Australian Bureau of Statistics. Labour force, Australia, detailed. ABS. Retrieved from https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia-detailed/latest-release, 2021; Hayne, Final report: Royal commission into misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry, Volume 1. Commonwealth of Australia, 2019a). Furthermore, there is minimal literature on the role of Indigenous storytelling to heighten moral awareness in the finance industry which was found to lead to better ethical outcomes.},

  abstract = {The book that started the Quiet RevolutionAt least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts---Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak---that we owe many of the great contributions to society.~In Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts---from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.Now with Extra Libris material, including a reader's guide and bonus content},

The purpose of this volume is to provide examples of how service learning can be integrated into courses addressing social justice issues. At the same time, it is about demonstrating the power of service learning in advancing a course content that is community-based and socially engaged.To stimulate the adaptation of the approaches described in these books, each volume includes an Activity / Methodology table that summarizes key elements of each example, such as class size, pedagogy, and other disciplinary applications.

  abstract = {Effectively analyzing literature can be challenging for those unfamiliar with studies from rapidly evolving research fields. Previous studies have shown that incorporating primary literature promotes scientific literacy and critical thinking skills. We've used collaborative note-taking and annotation of peer-reviewed articles to increase student engagement with course content and primary literature. Participants annotate articles using the web-annotation tool Hypothes.is and have access to comments from their peers. Groups are then assigned to summarize the annotations and findings, posting a synthesis for the course's Hypothes.is group. In parallel, students contribute to common notes. The instructor generates a weekly video discussing the student notes. The goal of these activities is to foster an environment of open annotation and co-creation of knowledge to aid in studying for deeper learning. Compiled notes can be used to create an open educational resource (OER). The OER provides an entry point for future students and the public. Based on the evaluation of annotations, notes, and assessments, we conclude that these activities encourage student engagement and achievement of learning outcomes while raising awareness of the importance of open and collaborative practices.},

With a better understanding of the most common difficulties in the SLR process, mentors will be better prepared to guide novices through the process. This understanding will help researchers have more realistic expectations of the SLR process and will help mentors guide novices through its planning, execution, and documentation phases. Consequently, the objectives of this work are to identify the most difficult and time-consuming phases of the SLR process. Using data from two sources - 52 responses to an online survey sent to all authors of SLRs published in software engineering venues and qualitative experience reports from 8 PhD students who conducted SLRs as part of a course - we identified specific difficulties related to each phase of the SLR process. Our findings highlight the importance of planning, teamwork, and mentoring by an experienced researcher throughout the process. The paper also identifies implications for the teaching of the SLR process.},

Utilizing the wisdom and grace of one of the best Tango instructors in the United States, we get new insights into how the partner in the follower role can bring out the creativity of the partner in the leader role. We also witness how poor following in its various forms can undermine the leader and undo the partnership. Chaleff, who has been recognized in the Harvard Business Review as one of the three pioneers in the emerging field of followership, has teamed with Sharna Fabiano, founder of Tangomercurio and the Tango Mercurio Community Orchestra in Washington, DC  http://www.tangomercurio.org to produce a unique and aesthetically charming video. In between each dance sequence Sharna and her partner Isaac Oboka dialogue about what Isaac as the leader experienced when Sharna demonstrates a variety of poor following. Their unrehearsed banter is delightful and instructive. In the final sequence, Sharna demonstrates how a strong follower can steady a leader who has lost balance -- something leaders in every sphere of life need at one time or another. Kevin Good http://www.crisislab.com as director, videographer and editor, has created a visually stunning experience that will surprise and delight YouTube viewers.},

Two case studies will be described to revisit the importance of building a rapport, learning the patient's story in a humble and respectful way, and addressing the social inequality and heath disparity of which we should be aware in a patient--nurse encounter. The possibility for collaboration between theologians and Christian nurses should be further explored in the future.},

  abstract = {Within the discipline of communication, the concept of ``cultural identities'' has captivated, fascinated, and received sustained attention from scholars of communication and culture over time. Like the concept of ``culture,'' which is varied, complex, and at times contested, the study of cultural identity has been approached from diverse lenses, whether theoretically, methodologically, or ontologically. In one sense,               cultural identity               can be understood as the experience, enactment, and negotiation of dynamic social identifications by group members within particular settings. As an individual identifies with---or desires acceptance into---multiple groups, people tend to experience, enact, or negotiate not just one cultural identity at a time but often multiple cultural identities at once. Further, how one experiences her/his intersecting cultural identities with others can vary from context to context depending on the setting, the issue at hand, the people involved, etc. Not surprisingly, intercultural communication scholars have contributed quite a number of theories concerning cultural identities within communication interactions: co-cultural theory, cultural contract theory, and identity negotiation theory, to name a few. In addition, intercultural communication scholars have offered rich cases that examine dynamic enactments, negotiations, or contestations of cultural identities across important contexts such as race, media, and globalization. Ultimately, the study of cultural identities offers rich understandings for both oneself and others. As the world that we inhabit is becoming increasingly diverse, the study of cultural identities will continue to gain traction within the communication discipline and beyond.},

Despite the tremendous challenges facing these immigrant students in their schooling, the children of immigrants in Canada perform compatibly with their peers with Canadian-born parents in educational achievement overall, and the 2 groups have similar labor market outcomes in the long run. This largely results in the educational policy that commits to an equal chance in school with fairness and equal access, and promotes the importance of first language use and cultural identity in the context of language and academic development simultaneously.

  abstract = {No, it isn't just you --- the pace of change has picked up. More than that, whereas we used to experience disruptions followed by periods of stability, change now is increasingly perpetual, pervasive, and exponential. To keep pace, leaders need to take a different approach than the ``leader as hero'' model --- the solo, individualistic leader who inspires certainty in a deterministic way forward. The authors suggest a new approach, which they call Sapient Leadership, inspired by conversations held at Stanford in the spring of 2020 with Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart; Toby Cosgrove, former CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, heart surgeon, and White House advisor; Halla T{\'o}masd{\'o}ttir, CEO of The B Team, and runner-up in Iceland's 2016 presidential elections; and Bret Taylor, President and COO of Salesforce. These leaders articulate a humble, nimble, and value-driven vision for leadership. Leader humility, authenticity, and openness instills trust and psychological safety. In turn, trust and psychological safety empower individuals and teams to perform at their highest capabilities. Additionally, continuously learning teams are essential for keeping pace with and effectively navigating 3-D change. Finally, shared purpose and common values enhance focus, cohesion, and resilience in the midst of 3-D change.},

The research composed of 80 students from Vocational Certificate of Education year 1 of Siam Business Administration Nonthaburi Technological College and were divided into two groups with a group of 40 each through simple random sampling method: experimental group and control group. The tools of the research were Imagineering Gamification model and the system of Interactive Augmented Reality for developing Digital Literacy skills, which were qualified by the field experts. The research result showed that learning through Imagineering Gamification using Interactive Augmented Reality was suitable with a very good level of overall outcome. The mean of Imagineering Gamification model was 4.96 (S.D. = 0.06) and the mean of the system of Interactive Augmented Reality for developing Digital Literacy skills was 4.98 (S.D. = 0.03). The mean of Digital Literacy skills evaluation, before and after learning, was 4.65 (S.D. = 1.57) and 17.78 (S.D. = 1.60) respectively, and the t-test result was 36.82 with a level of statistical significance of .01. The mean of evaluation of the experimental group's learning achievements after learning was 18.43 (S.D. = 1.61); the mean of evaluation of the control group's learning achievements after learning was 14.40 (S.D. = 1.74), and the t-test result was 10.40 with a level of statistical significance of .01. The survey of students' satisfaction from using the material has a very good level of overall outcome with the mean of 4.89 (S.D. = 0.32).},

Current efforts in positive psychology are deconstructed to reveal an adherence to the dominant Western conception of self and its accompanying vision of the good life as personal fulfillment. It is argued that in failing to recognize the tacit cultural and moral assumptions underlying their investigations, positive psychologists not only distort the outlooks of cultures that do not subscribe to an individualistic framework, they also insulate themselves from reflecting critically on their work. Alternative forms of inquiry are offered to assist positive psychology in overcoming these limitations.},

We hypothesized that EI would make a unique contribution to understanding the relationship between stress and three important mental health variables, depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation. University students (n=302) participated in a cross-sectional study that involved measuring life stress, objective and self-reported emotional intelligence, and mental health. Regression analyses revealed that stress was associated with: (1) greater reported depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation among people high in emotional perception (EP) compared to others; and (2) greater suicidal ideation among those low in managing others' emotions (MOE). Both EP and MOE were shown to be statistically different from other relevant measures, suggesting that EI is a distinctive construct as well as being important in understanding the link between stress and mental health.},

Debates over the definition of leadership are really debates over what researchers think constitutes good leadership. The ultimate question is not ``What is leadership?'' but ``What is good leadership?'' The word good is refers to both ethics and competence. Research into leadership ethics would explore the ethical issues of current leadership research, serve as a critical study of the field, analyze and expand normative theories of leadership, and develop new theories, research questions and ways of thinking about leadership.},

In Teaching Online, Claire Howell Major describes for college faculty the changes that accompany use of such technologies and offers real-world strategies for surmounting digital teaching challenges.Teaching with these evolving media requires instructors to alter the ways in which they conceive of and do their work, according to Major. They must frequently update their knowledge of learning, teaching, and media, and they need to develop new forms of instruction, revise and reconceptualize classroom materials, and refresh their communication patterns. Faculty teaching online must also reconsider the student experience and determine what changes for students ultimately mean for their own work and for their institutions. Teaching Online presents instructors with a thoughtful synthesis of educational theory, research, and practice as well as a review of strategies for managing the instructional changes involved in teaching online. In addition, this book presents examples of best practices from successful online instructors as well as cutting-edge ideas from leading scholars and educational technologists. Faculty members, researchers, instructional designers, students, administrators, and policy makers who engage with online learning will find this book an invaluable resource.},

James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.Learn how to:make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);overcome a lack of motivation and willpower;design your environment to make success easier;get back on track when you fall off course;...and much more.Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.},

Different servant leadership measures have been validated to date and a clear distinction has been made between the theory of servant leadership and other leadership theories. However, it seems that research on the implementation of servant leadership within an organisation is still in need. The main functions of a servant leader are not yet conceptualised in the literature to help researchers or practitioners to implement servant leadership successfully within organisations. After conducting a systematic literature review, the main functions of a servant leader were identified. These functions were clustered into strategic servant leadership and operational servant leadership and supported by servant leadership characteristics and competencies as defined by current literature. The results of this study might help practitioners to develop servant leaders more effectively and assist organisations to cultivate a servant leadership culture within companies. Limitations and future research needs are discussed.},

This article contributes to the debate by articulating a model of how rational decision making, intuitive decision making, and emotion influence each other: the critical decision vortex. The critical decision vortex emerges from a discussion between an emergency room (ER) doctor and a management scholar. The experience of the doctor diagnosing and treating patients in the ER provides the background for a reflection on decision making in critical conditions. One of the main findings of this collaborative effort is that to be effective, ER doctors, like managers, need to remain centered in the critical decision vortex; they need to attend equally to their analytical conclusions, the intuitive hunches that come from their experience, and remain open and attentive to their emotions.},

  abstract = {Today's challenging global business and economic environment makes it necessary to develop strategic thinkers who perform well together and deliver results. Traditional ways of thinking about strategy may limit one's ability to effectively address and adapt to the ever-changing conditions and turbulent environment in which organizations operate. A McKinsey Quarterly study of 1300 global executives found that the highest performing organizations had a clear purpose, an understanding of strengths, shared aspirations, and leaders who knew how to unleash opportunities with a result-driven process. This chapter introduces SOAR (Strengths, Opportunities, Aspirations, and Results), an evidenced-based framework that is a profoundly positive approach to strategic thinking, planning, and leading used by hundreds of international organizations to build strategic capacity at the individual, team, and the organization level. SOAR's operating system is Appreciative Inquiry, one of the most effective and widely used approaches for fostering positive change. SOAR creates a reservoir of positive energy to frame issues from a solution-oriented perspective that is generative and focused on strengths, new ideas, innovations and the best in people to emerge. SOAR begins with a strategic dialogue among all stakeholders in a team or organization into what is working well (strengths), what are possibilities for growth (opportunities), what are individual and shared desires (aspirations), and what are measures of success (results). In this chapter, the convergence of research and practice on SOAR is discussed. Next, results are presented of empirical research on SOAR's role in building positive strategic capacity via the SOAR profile, a rapid assessment instrument used by individuals and teams to create a baseline understanding of one's natural ability to think, plan, and lead strategically from a SOAR-based perspective. The chapter concludes with a discussion of SOAR's role in promoting an inclusive environment that facilitates performance among multicultural teams and organizations in which SOAR-based strategy is a dynamic and generative process that focuses on strengths, whole system solutions, and stakeholder inclusion while building positive psychological capital.},

  abstract = {The concept of praxis, also known as the practical discourse in philosophy, has been expressed in different ways in different eras. However, the linkages from one era to another and from one paradigm to another are not well explicated in the nursing literature. Difficulties with translations of `praxis' into `practice' and the connotations of the word `practical' in the English language and in nursing have influenced extrapolation of the linkages. More recently, further blurring of the linkages occurred from the popular association of praxis within the emancipatory paradigm. Integral to the concept of praxis, since the time of Aristotle, is the notion of phronesis: a process of moral reasoning enacted to establish the `good' of a particular situation, often referred to as practical wisdom. The purposes of this paper are twofold. Firstly to demonstrate a number of linkages and shifts in the evolution of praxis. This, I believe, will enhance understanding of the multiple expressions of praxis in contemporary nursing. Secondly, to promote and affirm the importance of praxiological knowledge development in the discipline. Furthermore, increased appreciation of the concept of praxis provides an important vehicle for the advancement of nursing as a moral endeavour and the nurse as moral agent.},

  abstract = {Many studies have been carried out about the effectiveness of optimism as a psychological phenomenon, leading to various theoretical formulations of the same concept, conceptualized as ``disposition'', ``attributional style'', ``cognitive bias'', or ``shared illusion''. This overview is an attempt to explore the ``optimism'' concept and its relations with mental health, physical health, coping, quality of life and adaptation of purpose, health lifestyle and risk perception. , Positive and negative expectations regarding the future are important for understanding the vulnerability to mental disorders, in particular mood and anxiety disorders, as well as to physical illness. A significant positive relation emerges between optimism and coping strategies focused on social support and emphasis on positive aspects of stressful situations. Through employment of specific coping strategies, optimism exerts an indirect influence also on the quality of life. There is evidence that optimistic people present a higher quality of life compared to those with low levels of optimism or even pessimists. Optimism may significantly influence mental and physical well-being by the promotion of a healthy lifestyle as well as by adaptive behaviours and cognitive responses, associated with greater flexibility, problem-solving capacity and a more efficient elaboration of negative information.},

No one articulates how that vision can be reached---for every student and teacher---more daringly, more practically, and more inclusively, than Katie Novak. Having them together in one book not only helps us reimagine the goals and practices of education, it reminds us of why we ever wanted to be teachers at all.''---David Rose, PhD, CAST's cofounder and chief education officer, emeritus``An incredible book! Innovate Inside the Box speaks to educators who are the change agents in their sphere of influence.''---Sarah Thomas, PhD, founder of EduMatch``George and Katie's combined talents as spectacular storytellers drive this book.

  abstract = {Kids walk into schools full of wonder and questions. How you, as an educator, respond to students' natural curiosity can help further their own exploration and shape the way they learn today and in the future. The traditional system of education requires students to hold their questions and compliantly stick to the scheduled curriculum. But our job as educators is to provide new and better opportunities for our students. It's time to recognize that compliance doesn't foster innovation, encourage critical thinking, or inspire creativity--and those are the skills our students need to succeed. In The Innovator's Mindset, George Couros encourages teachers and administrators to empower their learners to wonder, to explore--and to become forward-thinking leaders. If we want innovative students, we need innovative educators. In other words, innovation begins with you. Ultimately, innovation is not about a skill set: it's about a mindset. The Innovator's Mindset is for you if: You are a superintendent, district administrator, or principal who wants to empower your staff to create a culture of innovation You are a school leader - at any level - and want to help students and educators become their personal best. You are a teacher who wants to create relevant learning experiences and help students develop the skills they need to be successful. You'll be inspired to: Connect with other innovative educators Support teachers and leaders as learners Tap into the strength of your learning community Create ongoing opportunities for innovation Seek more effective methods for measuring progress And, most importantly, embrace change and use it to do something amazing},

In families, it is exemplified by domestic violence and child abuse and in other situations by war, prisoner of war or refugee status, and human trafficking.

Complex trauma generates complex reactions, in addition to those currently included in the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This article examines the criteria contained in the diagnostic conceptualization of complex PTSD (CPTSD).

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on care homes in the United Kingdom, particularly for those residents living with dementia. The impetus for this article comes from a recent review conducted by the authors. That review, a qualitative media analysis of news and academic articles published during the first few months of the outbreak, identified ethical care as a key theme warranting further investigation within the context of the crisis. To explore ethical care further, a set of salient ethical values for delivering care to care home residents living with dementia during the pandemic was derived from a synthesis of relevant ethical standards, codes and philosophical approaches. The ethical values identified were caring, non-maleficence, beneficence, procedural justice, dignity in death and dying, well-being, safety, and personhood. Using these ethical values as a framework, alongside examples from contemporaneous media and academic sources, this article discusses the delivery of ethical care to care home residents with dementia within the context of COVID-19. The analysis identifies positive examples of ethical values displayed by care home staff, care sector organisations, healthcare professionals and third sector advocacy organisations. However, concerns relating to the death rates, dignity, safety, well-being and personhood~- of residents and staff~- are also evident. These shortcomings are attributable to negligent government strategy, which resulted in delayed guidance, lack of resources and Personal Protective Equipment, unclear data, and inconsistent testing. Consequently, this review demonstrates the ways in which care homes are underfunded, under resourced and undervalued.},

How do you build and sustain it in your group, or strengthen a culture that needs fixing? In The Culture Code, Daniel Coyle goes inside some of the world's most successful organizations---including the U.S. Navy's SEAL Team Six, IDEO, and the San Antonio Spurs---and reveals what makes them tick. He demystifies the culture-building process by identifying three key skills that generate cohesion and cooperation, and explains how diverse groups learn to function with a single mind. Drawing on examples that range from Internet retailer Zappos to the comedy troupe Upright Citizens Brigade to a daring gang of jewel thieves, Coyle offers specific strategies that trigger learning, spark collaboration, build trust, and drive positive change. Coyle unearths helpful stories of failure that illustrate what not to do, troubleshoots common pitfalls, and shares advice about reforming a toxic culture. Combining leading-edge science, on-the-ground insights from world-class leaders, and practical ideas for action, The Culture Code offers a roadmap for creating an environment where innovation flourishes, problems get solved, and expectations are exceeded. Culture is not something you are---it's something you do. The Culture Code puts the power in your hands. No matter the size of your group or your goal, this book can teach you the principles of cultural chemistry that transform individuals into teams that can accomplish amazing things together.},

So we're going to try to do two things in this series. Help show you the usefulness of statistics, but also help you become a more informed consumer of statistics. From probabilities, paradoxes, and p-values there's a lot to cover in this series, and there will be some math, but we promise only when it's most important. But first, we should talk about what statistics actually are, and what we can do with them. Statistics are tools, but they can't give us all the answers.

In the 19th Century, the United States was changing rapidly, as we noted in the recent Market Revolution and Reform Movements episodes. Things were also in a state of flux for women. The reform movements, which were in large part driven by women, gave these self-same women the idea that they could work on their own behalf, and radically improve the state of their own lives. So, while these women were working on prison reform, education reform, and abolition, they also started talking about equal rights, universal suffrage, temperance, and fair pay. Women like Susan B. Anthony, Carry Nation, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the Grimk{\'e}s, and Lucretia Mott strove tirelessly to improve the lot of American women, and it worked, eventually. John will teach you about the Christian Temperance Union, the Seneca Falls Convention, the Declaration of Sentiments, and a whole bunch of other stuff that made life better for women. Hey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode. Few women were as vocal for women's rights during the 19th century as Susan B. Anthony: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/the-l...

Data from 5 studies using a common assessment battery were pooled to evaluate the magnitude of change in positive quality of life and explore the relation of change in positive quality of life to change in symptoms and how these relations vary by disorder. Positive quality of life was measured at intake, termination, and during 2 posttreatment visits 6 and 12 months following termination. Results revealed that positive quality of life improved moderately over the course of psychotherapy and was sustained through follow-up. Levels of positive quality of life and the degree of change in positive quality of life varied considerably by disorder. There were also moderately sized correlations between changes in positive quality of life and changes in symptomatic response and interpersonal functioning from intake to termination. Implications of the findings for clinical practice and future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The monograph targets four sociocultural groups (African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans). The document emphasizes the cultural strengths inherent in all cultures and examines how the system of care can more effectively deal with cultural differences and related treatment issues. In dealing with cultural differences, there is a need to clarify policy, training, resources, practice, and research issues, and cultural competence should be viewed as a developmental process. Five elements contributing to a system's, institution's, or agency's ability to become more culturally competent are  identified: value diversity, cultural self-assessment, consciousness of the dynamics of cultural interaction, institutionalization of cultural knowledge, and development of adaptations to diversity. Cultural competence must be developed at the policymaking, administrative, practitioner, and consumer levels. Service adaptations developed in response to cultural diversity may impact on intake and client identification, assessment and treatment, communication and interviewing, case management, out-of-home care, and guiding principles. Planning for cultural competence involves assessment, support building, facilitating leadership, including the minority family and community, developing resources, training and technical assistance, setting goals, and outlining action steps.

He discusses such ideas as why creative individuals are often seen as selfish and arrogant, and why the tortured genius is largely a myth.

  abstract = {What is morality? And to what extent does it vary around the world? The theory of ``morality-as-cooperation'' argues that morality consists of a collection of biological and cultural solutions to the problems of cooperation recurrent in human social life. Morality-as-cooperation draws on the theory of non-zero-sum games to identify distinct problems of cooperation and their solutions, and it predicts that specific forms of cooperative behavior---including helping kin, helping your group, reciprocating, being brave, deferring to superiors, dividing disputed resources, and respecting prior possession---will be considered morally good wherever they arise, in all cultures. To test these predictions, we investigate the moral valence of these seven cooperative behaviors in the ethnographic records of 60 societies. We find that the moral valence of these behaviors is uniformly positive, and the majority of these cooperative morals are observed in the majority of cultures, with equal frequency across all regions of the world. We conclude that these seven cooperative behaviors are plausible candidates for universal moral rules, and that morality-as-cooperation could provide the unified theory of morality that anthropology has hitherto lacked.}

The strength of this model is that it can increase interaction between students anytime and anywhere. Rapidly growing technology integration has brought powerful changes to the education system and improved digital skills for students and lecturers. Technology can also influence how think, learn, and interact.

Using a sample of approximately 1200 public organizations in the United States, we found that while each dimension accounts for unique variance in the adoption of innovation, organizational characteristics and top managers' attitudes toward innovation have a stronger influence than environmental and top managers' demographic characteristics. We also found no difference in the direction of effects of any antecedent, but did find differences in the significance of effects of several antecedents, on the phases of innovation adoption. We discuss the implications of these findings and suggest ideas for future research.},

However, not all theories and models that link personality to health have been supported empirically. Herein, historical theories and models are described briefly, e.g., Hippocrates' ancient model of four human temperaments and Type A and Type B personalities. Furthermore, a broad overview of current and scientifically investigated personality constructs and their associations to health is provided, spanning across the so-called ``Big Five,'' together with gender, intelligence, emotional intelligence, and motivational factors. Finally, methodological challenges and future directions in research on health and personality are discussed.},

This article imagines and initiates such a new dialogue among educational researchers and teacher educators about the intellectual resources that can best support inclusive educators everywhere. As inclusive education gets increasingly taken up within international policy discourses, it may be imperative to explore and identify theories and ideas that can be responsive to diverse and hugely unequal contexts of schooling. This article forwards an initial collection of intellectual resources for an inclusive education that can accommodate such complex schooling conditions and invites rich scholarly exchange on this issue.},

  abstract = {The framework for teaching is a research-based set of components of instruction that are grounded in a constructivist view of learning and teaching. The framework may be used for many purposes, but its full value is realized as the foundation for professional conversations among practitioners as they seek to enhance their skill in the complex task of teaching. The framework may be used as the foundation of a school's or district's recruitment and hiring, mentoring, coaching, professional development, and teacher evaluation processes, thus linking all those activities together and helping teachers become more thoughtful practitioners. The actions teachers can take to improve student learning are clearly identified and fall under four domains of teaching responsibility: Planning and Preparation, the School Environment, Instruction, and Professional Responsibilities. Within the domains are 22 components and 76 descriptive elements that further refine our understanding of what teaching is all about. The framework defines four levels of performance--Unsatisfactory, Basic, Proficient, and Distinguished--for each element, providing a valuable tool that all teachers can use. This second edition has been revised and updated and also includes frameworks for school specialists, such as school nurses, counselors, library and media specialists, and instructional coaches. Comprehensive, clear, and applicable to teaching across the K--12 spectrum, the framework for teaching described in this book is based on the PRAXIS III: Classroom Performance Assessment criteria developed by Educational Testing Service and is compatible with INTASC standards.},

This book provides background information to clarify such concepts as: determinants of health; how health systems are organized and financed (including international comparisons); health economics; health ethics; and roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders, including government, providers, and patients.

An alternative model suggesting friendship quality as the mediator was also tested to enhance confidence in the proposed model. SEM analyses revealed that perceived mattering mediated the association of friendship with happiness only in the American sample. In the Turkish sample, friendship quality mediated the association between mattering and happiness. Findings highlight the importance of cross-cultural research and suggest that the underlying processes and psychological mechanisms related to the friendship-happiness link might be different in different cultures.},

  abstract = {The term digital citizen is used with different meanings. According to the definition provided by Karen Mossberger, one of the authors of Digital Citizenship: The Internet, Society, and Participation, digital citizens are "those who use the internet regularly and effectively." In this sense, a digital citizen is a person using information technology (IT) in order to engage in society, politics, and government.  More recent elaborations of the concept define digital citizenship as the self-enactment of people's role in society through the use of digital technologies, stressing the empowering and democratizing characteristics of the citizenship idea. These theories aim at taking into account the ever increasing datafication of contemporary societies (as can be symbolically linked to the Snowden leaks), which radically called into question the meaning of ``being (digital) citizens in a datafied society'', also referred to as the ``algorithmic society'', which is characterised by the increasing datafication of social life and the pervasive presence of surveillance practices -- see surveillance and surveillance capitalism, the use of Artificial Intelligence, and Big Data. Datafication presents crucial challenges for the very notion of citizenship, so that data collection can no longer be seen as an issue of privacy alone so that:We cannot simply assume that being a citizen online already means something (whether it is the ability to participate or the ability to stay safe) and then look for those whose conduct conforms to this meaning Instead, the idea of digital citizenship shall reflect the idea that we are no longer mere ``users'' of technologies since they shape our agency both as individuals and as citizens. Digital citizenship is the responsible and respectful use of technology to engage online, find reliable sources, and protect and promote human rights. It teaches skills to communicate, collaborate, and act positively on any online platform. It also teaches empathy, privacy protection, and security measures to prevent data breaches and identity theft},

Digital footprints can be classified as either passive or active. The former is composed of a user's web-browsing activity and information stored as cookies. The latter is often released deliberately by a user to share information on websites or social media. While the term usually applies to a person, a digital footprint can also refer to a business, organization or corporation. The use of a digital footprint has both positive and negative consequences. On one side, it is the subject of many privacy issues. For example, without an individual's authorization, strangers can piece together information about that individual by only using search engines. Corporations are also able to produce customized ads based on browsing history. On the other hand, others can reap the benefits by profiting off their digital footprint as social media influencers. Furthermore, employers use a candidate's digital footprint for online vetting and assessing fit due to its reduced cost and accessibility. Between two equal candidates, a candidate with a positive digital footprint may have an advantage. As technology usage becomes more widespread, even children generate larger digital footprints with potential positive and negative consequences such as college admissions. Since it is hard not to have a digital footprint, it is in one's best interest to create a positive one.},

  title = {Digital Identity},
  year = 2024,
  month = jul,
  journal = {Wikipedia},
  abstract = {A digital identity is data stored on computer systems relating to an individual, organization, application, or device. For individuals, it involves the collection of personal data that is essential for facilitating automated access to digital services, confirming one's identity on the internet, and allowing digital systems to manage interactions between different parties. It is a component of a person's social identity in the digital realm, often referred to as their online identity. Digital identities are composed of the full range of data produced by a person's activities on the internet, which may include usernames and passwords, search histories, dates of birth, social security numbers, and records of online purchases. When such personal information is accessible in the public domain, it can be used by others to piece together a person's offline identity. Furthermore, this information can be compiled to construct a "data double"---a comprehensive profile created from a person's scattered digital footprints across various platforms. These profiles are instrumental in enabling personalized experiences on the internet and within different digital services. Should the exchange of personal data for online content and services become a practice of the past, an alternative transactional model must emerge. As the internet becomes more attuned to privacy concerns, media publishers, application developers, and online retailers are re-evaluating their strategies, sometimes reinventing their business models completely. Increasingly, the trend is shifting towards monetizing online offerings directly, with users being asked to pay for access through subscriptions and other forms of payment, moving away from the reliance on collecting personal data. Navigating the legal and societal implications of digital identity is intricate and fraught with challenges. Misrepresenting one's legal identity in the digital realm can pose numerous threats to a society increasingly reliant on digital interactions, opening doors for various illicit activities. Criminals, fraudsters, and terrorists could exploit these vulnerabilities to perpetrate crimes that can affect the virtual domain, the physical world, or both.},

  title = {Digital Native},
  year = 2025,

  journal = {Wikipedia},
  abstract = {The term digital native describes a person who has grown up in the information age. The term "digital native" was coined by Marc Prensky, an American writer, speaker and technologist who wrote several articles referencing this subject. This term specifically applied to the generation that grew up in the "digital age," predominantly regarding individuals born from 1980 onwards, namely Millennials, Generation Z, and Generation Alpha. Individuals from these demographic cohorts can quickly and comfortably locate, consume and send digital information through electronic devices and platforms such as computers, mobile phones, and social media. Digital natives are distinguished from digital immigrants, people who grew up in a world dominated by print and television, because they were born before the advent of the Internet. The digital generation grew up with increased confidence in the technology that they were encircled and engulfed in. This was thanks in part to their predecessors growing interest into a subject that was previously an unknown. Due to their upbringing, this digital generation of youth became fixated on their technologies as it became an ingrained, integral and essential way of life. Prensky concluded that due to the volume of daily interactions with technology, the digital native generation had developed a completely different way of thinking. Though the brains may not have changed physically, pathways and thinking patterns had evolved, and brains had changed to be physiologically different than those of the bygone era. Repeated exposure had helped grow and stimulate certain regions of the brain, while other unused parts of the brain were reduced in size. The terms digital native and digital immigrant are often used to describe the digital generation gap in terms of the ability of technological use among people born after 1980 and those born before. The term digital native is a highly contested concept, being considered by many education researchers as a persistent myth not founded on empirical evidence, and many argue for a more nuanced approach in understanding the relationship between digital media, learning and youth.},

  urldate = {2025-08-13},
  abstract = {Digital redlining is the practice of creating and perpetuating inequities between already marginalized groups specifically through the use of digital technologies, digital content, and the internet. The concept of digital redlining is an extension of the practice of redlining in housing discrimination, a historical legal practice in the United States and Canada dating back to the 1930s where red lines were drawn on maps to indicate poor and primarily black neighborhoods that were deemed unsuitable for loans or further development, which created great economic disparities between neighborhoods. The term was popularized by Dr. Chris Gilliard, a privacy scholar, who defines digital redlining as "the creation and maintenance of tech practices, policies, pedagogies, and investment decisions that enforce class boundaries and discriminate against specific groups". Though digital redlining is related to the digital divide and techniques such as weblining and personalization, it is distinct from these concepts as part of larger complex systemic issues. It can refer to practices that create inequities of access to technology services in geographical areas, such as when internet service providers decide to not service specific geographic areas because they are perceived to be not as profitable and thus reduce access to crucial services and civic participation. It can also be used to refer to inequities caused by the policies and practices of digital technologies. For instance, with these methods inequities are accomplished through divisions that are created via algorithms which are hidden from the technology user; the use of big data and analytics allow for a much more nuanced form of discrimination that can target specific vulnerable populations. These algorithmic means are enabled through the use of unregulated data technologies that apply a score to individuals that statistically categorize personality traits or tendencies which are similar to a credit score but are proprietary to the technology companies and not under outside oversight.},

  year = 2024,

  journal = {Wikipedia},
  abstract = {Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are organizational frameworks which seek to promote the fair treatment and full participation of all people, particularly groups who have historically been underrepresented or subject to discrimination on the basis of identity or disability. These three notions (diversity, equity, and inclusion) together represent "three closely linked values" which organizations seek to institutionalize through DEI frameworks. The concepts predate this terminology and other variations include diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB), inclusion and diversity (I\&D), justice, equity, diversity and inclusion (JEDI or EDIJ), or diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (IDEA, DEIA or DEAI). Diversity refers to the presence of variety within the organizational workforce, such as in identity and identity politics. It includes gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, age, culture, class, religion, or opinion. Equity refers to concepts of fairness and justice, such as fair compensation and substantive equality. More specifically, equity usually also includes a focus on societal disparities and allocating resources and "decision making authority to groups that have historically been disadvantaged", and taking "into consideration a person's unique circumstances, adjusting treatment accordingly so that the end result is equal." Finally, inclusion refers to creating an organizational culture that creates an experience where "all employees feel their voices will be heard", and a sense of belonging and integration. DEI is most often used to describe certain "training" efforts, such as diversity training. Though DEI is best known as a form of corporate training, it also finds implementation within many types of organizations, such as within academia, schools, and hospitals. In recent years, DEI efforts and policies have generated criticism, some directed at the specific effectiveness of its tools, such as diversity training, its effect on free speech and academic freedom, as well as more broadly attracting criticism on political or philosophical grounds. In addition, the term "DEI" has gained traction as an ethnic slur towards minority groups in the United States.},

Based on this model, we conduct a cluster analysis of the 154 team roles described in previous research.

The authors tested the importance of 1 noncognitive trait: grit. Defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals, grit accounted for an average of 4\% of the variance in success outcomes, including educational attainment among 2 samples of adults (N=1,545 and N=690), grade point average among Ivy League undergraduates (N=138), retention in 2 classes of United States Military Academy, West Point, cadets (N=1,218 and N=1,308), and ranking in the National Spelling Bee (N=175). Grit did not relate positively to IQ but was highly correlated with Big Five Conscientiousness. Grit nonetheless demonstrated incremental predictive validity of success measures over and beyond IQ and conscientiousness. Collectively, these findings suggest that the achievement of difficult goals entails not only talent but also the sustained and focused application of talent over time.

  abstract = {In this must-read book for anyone striving to succeed, pioneering psychologist Angela Duckworth shows parents, students, educators, athletes, and businesspeople---both seasoned and new---that the secret to outstanding achievement is not talent but a special blend of passion and persistence she calls "grit." Drawing on her own powerful story as the daughter of a scientist who frequently noted her lack of "genius," Duckworth, now a celebrated researcher and professor, describes her early eye-opening stints in teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience, which led to the hypothesis that what really drives success is not "genius" but a unique combination of passion and long-term perseverance. In Grit, she takes readers into the field to visit cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, teachers working in some of the toughest schools, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she's learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers---from J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to New Yorker cartoon editor Bob Mankoff to Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll. Among Grit's most valuable insights: why any effort you make ultimately counts twice toward your goal; how grit can be learned, regardless of IQ or circumstances; how lifelong interest is triggered; how much of optimal practice is suffering and how much is ecstasy; which is better for your child---a warm embrace or high standards; and the magic of the Hard Thing Rule. Winningly personal, insightful, and even life-changing, Grit is a book about what "goes through your head when you fall down, and how that---not talent or luck---makes all the difference.

A field concerned with well-being and optimal functioning, positive psychology aims to broaden the focus of clinical psychology beyond suffering and its direct alleviation. Our proposed conceptual framework parses happiness into three domains: pleasure, engagement, and meaning. For each of these constructs, there are now valid and practical assessment tools appropriate for the clinical setting. Additionally, mounting evidence demonstrates the efficacy and effectiveness of positive interventions aimed at cultivating pleasure, engagement, and meaning. We contend that positive interventions are justifiable in their own right. Positive interventions may also usefully supplement direct attempts to prevent and treat psychopathology and, indeed, may covertly be a central component of good psychotherapy as it is done now.},

Push the corners of your mind. Just get on this kind of continual learning roller coaster and see what happens." This was among the advice Apple CEO Tim Cook shared with students at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business on April 26th. Back on campus for his 25-year reunion, Cook took part in an hour-long dialogue with Fuqua Dean Bill Boulding and the students in a jam-packed Geneen Auditorium buzzing with excitement to hear from the leader of the world's most profitable company. The Apple CEO has embarked on a career far different than he had envisioned after graduating from Fuqua's Evening Executive MBA program in 1988. "For me the journey was not predictable at all. You have to find your own north star and stay with your north star." As 450 Daytime MBA students prepared to graduate, Cook advised the students to heed Abraham Lincoln's words of wisdom: "I will prepare and someday my chance will come." Cook shared the three keys to his leadership at Apple: people, strategy, and execution. "If you get those three right the world is a great place." Students were able to get a unique glimpse into Cook's motivation, inspiration and leadership role models. Raised in the south and a witness to racial injustice, Cook described his admiration for Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Junior's bravery in risking their lives to fight for what they believed in. He has just three photos in his office: two of Kennedy and one of King. Cook was asked when to follow strict principles of business theory and when to break the rules. His response stressed the importance of risks and learning from failure. "You should rarely follow the rules. What Fuqua teaches you so well is how to learn and how to collaborate. Write your own rules." This message resonated with first-year MBA student Shelby Hall. "I know this follows Steve Jobs' belief that Apple creates products which consumers didn't ever know existed," she said. "It was interesting to hear Tim Cook's perspective on how we should balance writing our own rules while applying the foundations of business taught here at Fuqua." Cook also spoke about some of his recollections from Fuqua. "The people made it an incredible experience. It was great for me to see how bright people approached solutions in different ways." First-year MBA student Juan Danzilo says Cook's willingness to share his experiences shows a deep commitment to Fuqua. "Tim Cook's presence reflects Fuqua's sense of community. His humility and eloquence is admirable. It certainly was a unique opportunity for MBA students to hear from such an inspirational leader."}

The theory begins by specifying basic needs and by suggesting how, as people pursue need-fulfilling goals, they build mental representations of their experiences (beliefs, representations of emotions, and representations of action tendencies). I then show how these needs, goals, and representations can serve as the basis of both motivation and personality, and can help to integrate disparate views of personality. The article builds on this framework to provide a new perspective on development, particularly on the forces that propel development and the roles of nature and nurture. I argue throughout that the focus on representations provides an important entry point for change and growth. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {In the wake of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and Canada's Truth \& Reconciliation Commission findings, higher ed is realizing just how much work lies ahead if it is to reconcile itself with Indigenous peoples, and indigenize the curriculum. Saskatchewan, where some projections say that 30\% of the population will be Indigenous by the year 2045, is in many ways the epicentre of indigenization.  This week, Ken Steele talks with Vianne Timmons, President \& Vice-Chancellor of the University of Regina, to better understand why Indigenization matters.  Vianne grew up in Labrador and is of Mi'kmaq heritage, but Ken is quite conscious of being a white settler of European ancestry. How can non-Indigenous people get over their reticence to talk about a challenging subject? Vianne reassures us that people appreciate genuine interest and a desire to learn, even if they make errors in protocol.  The University of Regina has been Indigenizing for 40 years. Vianne has an Executive Lead -- Indigenization who reports directly to her office, and an Aboriginal Advisory Circle that provides feedback. ``Shoulder to shoulder we work together to Indigenize our campus.'' The latest UofR strategic plan, ``peyak aski kikawinaw'', has Indigenization as a top priority.  First Nations University is a federated college of the University of Regina, independent administratively, but integrated academically. In 2009 there were unsubstantiated allegations of mismanagement that led the federal and provincial governments to suspend FNUC's funding. Indigenous communities and students protested, and the University of Regina stepped up to assume administrative oversight of FNUC for five years until it regained its independence. Now FNUC is financially stable, with solid leadership and growing enrolment. The UofR was presented with an Eagle Staff as a symbol to thank them for their advocacy, but also to challenge them to continue being warriors for truth and reconciliation, and Indigenous education rights.   The UofR's Aboriginal Advisory Circle defines Indigenization as ``the transformation of the existing academy by including indigenous knowledges, voices, critiques, scholars, students and materials, as well as the establishment of physical and epistemic spaces that facilitate the ethical stewardship of a plurality of indigenous knowledges and practices so thoroughly as to constitute an essential element of the university. Indigenization is not limited to Indigenous people, but encompasses all students and faculty, for the benefit of our academic integrity and our social viability.''  (See https://www.uregina.ca/strategic-plan... ) So to truly Indigenize, institutions need to include Indigenous peoples as students, faculty, and staff; include Indigenous scholarship and perspectives in curriculum; provide physical and symbolic spaces dedicated to Indigenous use; and re-think the foundations of the academy.  Indigenous peoples are the founding people of Canada, and institutions need to reflect their country -- but Indigenization benefits ALL students.  It provides them with a better appreciation of First Nations peoples, a more nuanced understanding of historical truth, and prepares them for a world in which indigenous peoples and settlers are truly reconciled. ``There is so much that went unsaid in our past, that needs to be spoken in our future.'' Vianne Timmons began her teaching career on the Babine First Nations Reserve in BC, and was appointed President of the University of Regina in 2008. She has helped advance Indigenization through dozens of initiatives, and two successive strategic plans. Vianne is one of 12 recipients of the national 2019 Indspire Award. Shot on location at First Nations University, on the University of Regina campus, in October 2018, by campus videography staff -- thank you again!  Next week, Ken's conversation with Vianne Timmons continues, as we explore ``100 Ways to Indigenize Your Campus.''

  abstract = {The ethics of care still appeals to many in spite of penetrating criticisms of it which have been presented over the past 15 years or so. This paper tries to offer an explanation for this, and then to critically engage with three versions of an ethics of care. The explanation consists firstly in the close affinities between nursing and care. The three versions identified below are by Gilligan (1982), a second by Tronto (1993), and a third by Gastmans (2006), see also Little (1998). Each version is described and then subjected to criticism. It is concluded that where the ethics of care is presented in a distinctive way, it is at its least plausible; where it is stated in more plausible forms, it is not sufficiently distinct from nor superior to at least one other common approach to nursing ethics, namely the much maligned 'four principles' approach. What is added by this paper to what is already known: as the article tries to explain, in spite of its being subjected to sustained criticism the ethics of care retains its appeal to many scholars. The paper tries to explain why, partly by distinguishing three different versions of an ethics of care. It is also shown that all three versions are beset with problems the least serious of which is distinctiveness from other approaches to moral problems in health care.},

We used language expressed on Twitter to characterize community-level psychological correlates of age-adjusted mortality from atherosclerotic heart disease (AHD).

Most correlations remained significant after controlling for income and education. A cross-sectional regression model based only on Twitter language predicted AHD mortality significantly better than did a model that combined 10 common demographic, socioeconomic, and health risk factors, including smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity.

As the social computing technology is relatively new, a review of literature revealed lack of research on the impact of ways of using social networking sites (SNS) on knowledge sharing and learning among tertiary students. This paper aims to empirically examine the various categories of SNS use including: chatting and online discussion, creating knowledge and information content, file sharing, and enjoyment and entertainment by tertiary students at a University in Saudi Arabia. It will investigate the impact of these categories of SNS use on knowledge sharing and learning performance. We adopted a cross sectional survey questionnaire for data collection, and received 308 valid responses from a sample of students that include graduates and undergraduates. The results show that there are significant positive relationships between both chatting and online discussion and file sharing and knowledge sharing, and entertainment and enjoyment with student learning. The paper concludes with a discussion of the limitations and implications of this study, along with directions for further research.},

In a 3rd study, persons with neuromuscular disease were randomly assigned to either the gratitude condition or to a control condition. The gratitude-outlook groups exhibited heightened well-being across several, though not all, of the outcome measures across the 3 studies, relative to the comparison groups. The effect on positive affect appeared to be the most robust finding. Results suggest that a conscious focus on blessings may have emotional and interpersonal benefits.},

Each tradition emphasizes the development of gratitude as a path to a good life, and prescribes approaches for practicing. Gratitude is explored further in the context of psychological theory and research. Empirical research linking gratitude with well-being and goal attainment is presented and discussed. Finally, future research questions and a tentative research agenda are presented.}

The objectives of this paper are to better understand the concept and its evolution in the healthcare sector, to propose an operational definition, and to describe some French and international experiences of benchmarking in the healthcare sector. To this end, we reviewed the literature on this approach's emergence in the industrial sector, its evolution, its fields of application and examples of how it has been used in the healthcare sector., Benchmarking is often thought to consist simply of comparing indicators and is not perceived in its entirety, that is, as a tool based on voluntary and active collaboration among several organizations to create a spirit of competition and to apply best practices. The key feature of benchmarking is its integration within a comprehensive and participatory policy of continuous quality improvement (CQI). Conditions for successful benchmarking focus essentially on careful preparation of the process, monitoring of the relevant indicators, staff involvement and inter-organizational visits., Compared to methods previously implemented in France (CQI and collaborative projects), benchmarking has specific features that set it apart as a healthcare innovation. This is especially true for healthcare or medical--social organizations, as the principle of inter-organizational visiting is not part of their culture. Thus, this approach will need to be assessed for feasibility and acceptability before it is more widely promoted.},

First, we provide a conceptual clarity of servant leadership vis-{\`a}-vis other value-based leadership approaches and offer a new definition of servant leadership. Second, we evaluate 16 existing measures of servant leadership in light of their respective rigor of scale construction and validation. Third, we map the theoretical and nomological network of servant leadership in relation to its antecedents, outcomes, moderators, mediators. We finally conclude by presenting a detailed future research agenda to bring the field forward encompassing both theoretical and empirical advancement.

  abstract = {Fake news or information disorder is false or misleading information (misinformation, including disinformation, propaganda, and hoaxes) presented as news. Fake news often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue. Although false news has always been spread throughout history, the term fake news was first used in the 1890s when sensational reports in newspapers were common. Nevertheless, the term does not have a fixed definition and has been applied broadly to any type of false information presented as news. It has also been used by high-profile people to apply to any news unfavorable to them. Further, disinformation involves spreading false information with harmful intent and is sometimes generated and propagated by hostile foreign actors, particularly during elections. In some definitions, fake news includes satirical articles misinterpreted as genuine, and articles that employ sensationalist or clickbait headlines that are not supported in the text. Because of this diversity of types of false news, researchers are beginning to favour information disorder as a more neutral and informative term. The prevalence of fake news has increased with the recent rise of social media, especially the Facebook News Feed, and this misinformation is gradually seeping into the mainstream media. Several factors have been implicated in the spread of fake news, such as political polarization, post-truth politics, motivated reasoning, confirmation bias, and social media algorithms. Fake news can reduce the impact of real news by competing with it. For example, a BuzzFeed News analysis found that the top fake news stories about the 2016 U.S. presidential election received more engagement on Facebook than top stories from major media outlets. It also particularly has the potential to undermine trust in serious media coverage. The term has at times been used to cast doubt upon credible news, and former U.S. president Donald Trump has been credited with popularizing the term by using it to describe any negative press coverage of himself. It has been increasingly criticized, due in part to Trump's misuse, with the British government deciding to avoid the term, as it is "poorly-defined" and "conflates a variety of false information, from genuine error through to foreign interference". Multiple strategies for fighting fake news are actively researched, for various types of fake news. Politicians in certain autocratic and democratic countries have demanded effective self-regulation and legally-enforced regulation in varying forms, of social media and web search engines. On an individual scale, the ability to actively confront false narratives, as well as taking care when sharing information can reduce the prevalence of falsified information. However, it has been noted that this is vulnerable to the effects of confirmation bias, motivated reasoning and other cognitive biases that can seriously distort reasoning, particularly in dysfunctional and polarised societies. Inoculation theory has been proposed as a method to render individuals resistant to undesirable narratives. Because new misinformation emerges frequently, researchers have stated that one solution to address this is to inoculate the population against accepting fake news in general (a process termed prebunking), instead of continually debunking the same repeated lies.},

The study investigates five case examples of business leadership to answer the research question of how the three-way interaction between visionary leadership, innovative leadership mindset, and business leadership approach may contribute to an organization's sustainable development. The main argument is that the three-way interaction is considerable for the continuous development of an organization. This study uses the purposeful sampling strategy that matches the aim of the study. Therefore, five case examples from five different industries (the technological industry, the airline industry, the mining industry, the banking industry, and the automotive industry) have been selected intentionally to understand the study argument and to gather information that will answer the research question. The analysis highlighted key qualities of visionary leadership, innovative leadership mindset, and the five leadership approaches. The study infers that the proper match between the performed leadership approach and the existing visionary leadership and innovative mindset can create a unique organizational identity that serves its differentiation and continuous development.},

Specifically, 1) how does EI affect previous mood states? 2) How does persons' emotional reactivity to different mood induction conditions depend on their EI? 3) How does EI help to a better mood recovery? For these purposes, 155 participants (123 women and 32 men) were measured for EI using Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS) one month before the experimental session. The TMMS assesses perceived ability to (a) attend to moods (Attention), (b) discriminate clearly among moods (Clarity), and (c) regulate moods (Repair). The experiment comprised three phases. At time 1 experimenter assessed mood states of the participants before mood induction. At time 2 (mood reactivity phase), participants were randomly assigned to one of the three experimental conditions: amusement, anger, and sadness mood conditions. Subsequently participants were assessed in their mood states. At time 3 (mood recovery phase), following a rest period participants were evaluated in mood states and intrusive thoughts measures. Results indicated that EI, specifically Clarity and Repair, was related to previous mood states, emotional reactivity to mood induction conditions, and emotional recovery. Clarity and Repair play different but complementary roles in processing emotional situations generated in laboratory context. In this sense, EI could join the list of personal and interpersonal factors that contribute to the efficient processing of positive and negative emotions.

In addition to nonlinear functions, interactions were explored. For example, we found that those who spend less time per week in PSW experience less negative affect when they spend more hours per day in PSW; however, those who spend more time per week in PSW experience more negative affect when they spend more hours per day in PSW. Additional findings for positive affect and eudaimonia will be discussed.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Teachers facilitate student learning, and when student learning outcomes need to improve, teaching practice needs to improve. Teachers may receive wonderful training, envision the ideal standard of teaching, know how to obtain it, and be provided with all the necessary resources to succeed; but teachers must purposefully reflect on that information to know how to incorporate it into teaching practice (Ramos-Rodrguez, Flores Martnez, \& Ponte, 2017, p. 87). Accurate, circumspect data concerning the individuals current teaching effectiveness is helpful for the teacher to effectively reflect and improve upon their teaching skill and practice (Salifu, Worlanyo, \& Kuyini, 2017, p. 725).{$<$}/p{$>$}  {$<$}p{$>$}Reflective teaching leads to improved student learning when teachers analytically reflect on their teaching practice, student interactions, and personal experience in order to accomplish a desired outcome (Ramos-Rodrguez et al., 2016, p. 89). Feedback from one source is good, but feedback from multiple sources such as oneself, students, colleagues, supervisors, and training materials will provide a more complete data set (Dobbs, p. 10; Vivekananda?Schmidt, MacKillop, Crossley, \& Wade, 2013, p. 439). Evaluations can focus on strengths only (Rath, 2017, p. 30) or look at the entire performance and skill set of the person being evaluated (Caretta-Weyer, Kraut, Kornegay, \& Yarris, pp. 367-368). Multiple-source feedback facilitates reflective teaching practices and helps instructors improve their teaching philosophy, pedagogy, and practice (Postholm, 2018, p. 429). Reflective teaching means better teaching, which means better student learning.{$<$}/p{$>$}  {$<$}p{$>$}This presentation will discuss the benefits of reflective teaching practices on multiple-source strength-focused and comprehensive feedback to improve teaching and learning outcomes. Additionally, it will suggest a 4-step pattern for incorporating what is learned; a) develop a plan to improve, b) seek a way to be held accountable, c) practice the actions, d) reflect on the outcomes (Sherman, 2012).{$<$}/p{$>$}  {$<$}p{$>$}References{$<$}br /p{$>$}  {$<$}p style="margin-top: 0.0in; margin-right: 0.0in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.5in;"{$>$}Caretta-Weyer, H.

Mediational analyses showed that positive emotions experienced in the wake of the attacks--- gratitude, interest, love, and so forth---fully accounted for the relations between (a) precrisis resilience and later development of depressive symptoms and (b) precrisis resilience and postcrisis growth in psychological resources. Findings suggest that positive emotions in the aftermath of crises buffer resilient people against depression and fuel thriving, consistent with the broaden-and-build theory.

Coherent School Leadership will show you how to combine the components of Fullan's Coherence Framework (the Framework) with Kirtman's 7 Competencies for Highly Effective Leaders (the Competencies) to drive coherence---the shared depth of understanding about the nature of the work and how it impacts the results desired for student achievement---to change the culture in schools from reactive to proactive. Fullan and Kirtman, whose work is based in practice, will: - Show you how to use specific competencies to drive coherence - Provide examples that show how other leaders have successfully created coherence - Guide you through the day-to-day distractions/stresses so that you can stay on course - Show you how to use the Competencies in relation to the FrameworkTaking a world view of the forces that could destabilize education and the work of coherence, Coherent School Leadership will show how proven frameworks such as the Framework and the Competencies can help you cope with even the most complex scenarios.},

This new perspective of seeing the world differently is desperately needed in schools and begins with school leadership. Alyssa Gallagher and Kami Thordarson, widely recognized experts on Design Thinking, educational leadership, and innovative strategies, call this new perspective design-inspired leadership---one of the most powerful ways to ignite positive change and address education challenges using the same design and innovation principles that have been so successful in private industry. Design Thinking for School Leaders explores the changing landscape of leadership and offers practical ways to reframe the role of school leader using Design Thinking, one step at a time. Leaders can shift from'accidental designers'to'design-inspired leaders,'acting with greater intention and achieving greater impact. You'll learn how viewing the world through a more empathetic lens---a critical first step on the path to becoming a design-inspired leader---can raise your awareness of the uniqueness of your teachers and students and prompt you to question the ways in which they experience your school. Gallagher and Thordarson detail five specific roles to help you identify opportunities for positively impacting students, teachers, districts, parents, and the community: Opportunity Seeker. Shifts from problem solving to problem finding. Experience Architect. Designs and curates learning experiences. Rule Breaker. Challenges the way things are'always'done. Producer. Gets things done and creates rapid learning cycles for teams. Storyteller. Captures the hearts and minds of a community. Full of examples of Design Thinking in action in schools across the country, Design Thinking for School Leaders can help you guide your school to the forefront of the new design + education movement, one that will move traditional education into the modern world and drive the future of learning.},

The influence of the leader's and followers' personal histories and trigger events are considered as antecedents of authentic leadership and followership, as well as the reciprocal effects with an inclusive, ethical, caring and strength-based organizational climate. Positive modeling is viewed as a primary means whereby leaders develop authentic followers. Posited outcomes of authentic leader--follower relationships include heightened levels of follower trust in the leader, engagement, workplace well-being and veritable, sustainable performance. Testable propositions and directions for exploring them are presented and discussed.},

Garrison draws on his decades of experience and extensive research in the field to explore the technological, pedagogical, and organizational implications of e-learning. Most importantly, he provides practical models that educators can use to realize the full potential of e-learning. This book is unique in that it focuses less on the long list of ever-evolving technologies and more on the search for an understanding of these technologies from an educational perspective. The second edition has been fully revised and updated throughout and includes discussions of social media and mobile learning applications as well as other emerging technologies in today's classrooms. This book is an invaluable resource for courses on e-learning in higher education as well as for researchers, practitioners and senior administrators looking for guidance on how to successfully adopt e-learning in their institutions.},

  abstract = {Most executives think of decision-making as a singular event that occurs at a particular point in time. In reality, though, decision-making is a process fraught with power plays, politics, personal nuances, and institutional history. Leaders who recognize this make far better decisions than those who persevere in the fantasy that decisions are events they alone control. That said, some decision-making processes are far more effective than others. Most often, participants use an advocacy process, possibly the least productive way to get things done. They view decision-making as a contest, arguing passionately for their preferred solutions, presenting information selectively, withholding relevant conflicting data so that they can make a convincing case, and standing firm against opposition. Much more powerful is an inquiry process, in which people consider a variety of options and work together to discover the best solution. Moving from advocacy to inquiry re- quires careful attention to three critical factors: fostering constructive, rather than personal, conflict; making sure everyone knows that their viewpoints are given serious consideration even if they are not ultimately accepted; and knowing when to bring deliberations to a close. The authors discuss in detail strategies for moving from an advocacy to an inquiry process, as well as for fostering productive conflict, true consideration, and timely closure. And they offer a framework for assessing the effectiveness of your process while you're still in the middle of it. Decision-making is a job that lies at the very heart of leadership and one that requires a genius for balance: the ability to embrace the divergence that may characterize early discussions and to forge the unity needed for effective implementation.

Jamie Reed, a former Case Manager at the Washington University School of Medicine Pediatric Transgender Center at St Louis Children's Hospital reflects on her experiences inside the clinic that ultimately lead to her profound decision to file for whistleblower protection from the Missouri Attorney General's office in order to publicly express her concerns with the judgment and care provided for the patients at the gender clinic.  Jamie, who herself identifies in the LGBTQIA community and is also a proud mother of 5 children, has a Bachelor's Degree in Cultural Anthropology and a Master's of Science in Clinical Research Management. In her conversation with Sasha \& Stella, along with her attorney, Vernadette Broyles, not only does Jamie describe the experiences that lead to her ultimate formal filing of her concerns, but both Jamie and Vernadette speak to the protections available to other clinicians and workers in this field that feel too intimidated to speak out about their observations and concerns. Vernadette Ramirez Broyles is the President and General Counsel of Child Parental Rights Campaign, Inc., a not-for-profit public interest law firm that engages in litigation and advocacy across the country to protect children's health and defend parental rights from the impacts of gender identity ideology. Ms. Broyles received her law degree from Harvard Law School and received her undergraduate degree in Biology from Yale University.

RAND researchers present a historical overview of the integration of women into the U.S. military and explore the importance of cohesion and what influences it. The gender integration experiences of foreign militaries, as well as those of domestic police and fire departments, are examined for insights on effective policies. The potential one-time and recurring costs associated with integration are estimated as well. The report culminates in a summary of previous monitoring efforts and broad strategic monitoring issues, as well as recommendations to the Marine Corps for implementation."--[back cover]},

Therefore, this article discusses how a gamer\&\#039;s platform, Discord can be used as an interactive online class. A comparison of Discord with other online platforms is spelled out in a tabular form. The principle used to design the online class using Discord is based on Community of Inquiry (CoI). CoI consists of three elements which are teaching presence, social presence, and cognitive presence for a better educational experience. The design discussed in this article are Discord features design for the online class and class activity using Discord in developing the three elements in CoI. Data collection is done using open-ended surveys. They are 58 respondents with engineering and non-engineering students. Most of the students are familiar with Discord and agreed that Discord can be adapted for an online class. Thematic analysis is conducted to analyze the open-ended questions. The themes that can be identified are parallel channels, structure, all-in-one platform, facilitation, and learning environment. Another analysis is message counts in each student group to show how active the students in online class using Discord. In conclusion, Discord is the best platform to make students active and construct knowledge with peers.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

We conducted a qualitative, interpretive analysis of 36 Canadian health reform documents published during the period 1990--1999. The values raised in Canadian health reform rhetoric vary widely not only in topic (e.g. health states, health services, equity, economic viability, etc.) but also in substance (e.g. physical entities, goals, principles, attitudes, etc.). We review the diversity of concepts underlying `values talk' in health policy, and discuss implications for policy analysis and future research.},

This work explores why representation has been slow in accurately depicting nurses' responsibilities, impacts on public perceptions and professional identity. A critical realist review was employed as this method enables in-depth exploration into why something exists. A multidisciplinary approach was adopted, drawing from feminist, psychological and sociological theories to provide insightful understanding and recommendations. One main feminist lens has been implemented, using Laura Mulvey's 'Male-Gaze' framework for content analysis of three nurse-related advertisements to explore how the profession's female status influences representation, public perception and how this might impact nursing. Nurse representation has important real-world consequences. It is essential to improve unnecessary negative portrayals and contest ingrained stereotypes as there are costs to public opinion and nursing's self-identity. Nursing's female status has an impact within a male-dominated media industry, with a leisurely approach adopted toward changing representation. Media images become societally ingrained, this reiterates the significance of accurate/positive depictions. Social media is an instant method of communication with the public to combat stereotypes and maintain engagement to provide better understanding of what nurses do.},

With a sample of 456 Spanish adults (aged 18--80 years), the aims of this study were to examine: (1) whether variables related with the victims' appraisal of a specific offense (time elapsed, frequency, perceived severity, perceived intention) and their own beliefs about the nature of forgiveness (as either conditional or unconditional) are associated to their interpersonal forgiveness; (2) whether forgiveness plays a mediating role between the way in which victims appraise an offense and their levels of psychological well-being (PWB), and between their beliefs about the nature of forgiveness, and their levels of PWB; (3) the role that two different components of forgiveness (Absence of Negative and Presence of Positive feelings and thoughts about the hurt---"negF" and "posF", respectively) might play on these relationships. We found that adults who forgive others tend to enjoy a greater sense of PWB than those who are less willing to forgive offenses. Frequency of the offense, its perceived severity and its perceived intention were associated with less forgiveness. Forgiveness mediated the relationship between the victims' appraisal of the offense and their levels of PWB, specifically through negF (i.e., the victims' ability to leave behind the negative thoughts and feelings associated with the transgression). Finally, the belief that forgiveness is unconditional or conditional has different relationships not only with forgiveness, but also with the victims' PWB.},

  abstract = {Global citizenship education (GCED) is a form of civic learning that involves students' active participation in projects that address global issues of a social, political, economic, or environmental nature. The two main elements of GCE are 'global consciousness';  the moral or ethical aspect of global issues, and 'global competencies', or skills meant to enable learners to participate in changing and developing the world. The promotion of GCE was a response by governments and NGOs to the emergence of supranational institution, regional economic blocs, and the development of information and communications technologies. These have all resulted in the emergence of a more globally oriented and collaborative approach to education. GCE addresses themes such as peace and human rights, intercultural understanding, citizenship education, respect for diversity and tolerance, and inclusiveness. GCE provides the overall lens which views the role of education in the promotion of the rule of law (RoL). It draws upon experience from other education processes, including human rights education, peace education, education for sustainable development, education for international and intercultural understanding. GCE aims to empower learners to engage and assume active roles, both locally and globally, as proactive contributors to a more just, peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, secure and sustainable world. GCE aspires to be a transformative experience, to give learners the opportunities and competencies to realize their rights and obligations to promote a better world and future. GCE is built on a lifelong learning perspective. It is not only for children and youth but also for adults. It can be delivered in formal, non-formal and informal settings. For this reason, GCE is part and parcel of the Sustainable Development Goal 4 on Education (SDG4, Target 4.7). GCE is also a component of the single indicator for Target 12.8 in Sustainable Development Goal 12 for "responsible consumption and production".},

In a series of now-classic books that have been translated into 36 languages and reached millions of readers around the world, he has taught generations of readers how to make remarkable products and spread powerful ideas. In~Linchpin, he turns his attention to the individual, and explains how anyone can make a significant impact within their organization.~There used to be two teams in every workplace: management and labor. Now there's a third team, the linchpins. These people figure out what to do when there's no rule book. They delight and challenge their customers and peers. They love their work, pour their best selves into it, and turn each day into a kind of art.~~Have you ever found a shortcut that others missed? Seen a new way to resolve a conflict? Made a connection with someone others couldn't reach? Even once? Then you have what it takes to become indispensable, by overcoming the resistance that holds people back.

Therefore, we performed a systematic literature review with a sample of 37 SSCI articles published in the educational context. Within the scope of the selected studies, the advantages and disadvantages of AI chatbots in education for students and educators, as well as the types of chatbots used, year, keywords, and method were analyzed. According to the research results, increased motivation to learn and language skill development are advantages for students, while cost-effectiveness and reduced workload are advantages for educators. Limited interaction, misleading answers for learners, originality, and plagiarism are the most common disadvantages for educators.

This paper highlights the pervasive influence of a Cartesian metaphysics on the medical paradigm and its profound impact on the practice of perinatal nursing in North America. Background. Modern perinatal health care practices are founded on a Cartesian metaphysics that reduce birthing women to the status of object. Such practices deny the holistic aims of perinatal nursing. Methods. A philosophical inquiry informs the tenets of this metaphysical discussion regarding the foundations of perinatal nursing practices. Findings. Although perinatal health care is founded on a Cartesian metaphysics, an alternative paradigm of embodied practice is suggested as a way of viewing birthing women as embodied subjects. Conclusion. If the foundations of health care, which have been built on a Cartesian metaphysics, are not re-examined, perinatal nurses will be providing care that further reduce women to the status of object.},

Through vivid examples, Goleman delineates the five crucial skills of emotional intelligence, and shows how they determine our success in relationships, work, and even our physical well-being. What emerges is an entirely new way to talk about being smart. The best news is that "emotional literacy" is not fixed early in life.

Focusing on one academic class, students completed scales of classroom belonging and support, expectancies for success, and intrinsic interest and value; course grades and effort ratings were obtained from English teachers. Each of three belonging/support factors identified by principal components analysis contributed significantly to explaining variance in expectancies and value, with teacher support having the most consistently substantial influence across student subgroups. The strength of association between support and motivation dropped significantly from sixth to eighth grade. Teacher support was more closely related to motivation for girls than for boys. Expectancy was the primary predictor of class effort and grades. These findings underscore the importance of belonging and interpersonal support in fostering academic motivation and achievement.},

He felt that people could not be healthy if governments did not respect their rights and dignity as well as engage in health policies guided by sound ethical values. Nor could people have their rights and dignity if they were not healthy. Mann and his colleagues argued that public health and human rights are integrally connected: Human rights violations adversely affect the community's health, coercive public health policies violate human rights, and advancement of human rights and public health reinforce one another. Despite the deep traditions in public health, ethics, and human rights, they have rarely cross-fertilized---although there exists an important emerging literature. For the most part, each of these fields has adopted its own terminology and forms of reasoning. Consequently, Mann advocated the creation of a code of public health ethics and the adoption of a vocabulary or taxonomy of ``dignity violation''.},

  abstract = {Asynchronous teaching approaches have long been used to expand educational access to students with diverse needs, and thus, they are well suited to teaching under the conditions of uncertainty that characterize a time of pandemic. While asynchronous approaches are sometimes criticized for being less interactive than synchronous or face-to-face classes, I argue that these limitations can be overcome by providing structure and engagement opportunities for students while also maximizing the flexibility that is the major benefit of asynchronicity. In this essay, I present a six-part framework for designing asynchronous online classes, drawing on examples from my undergraduate interdisciplinary social science courses on contemporary Japan and Asia. First, instructors can maximize flexibility by ``thinking small,'' modularizing lectures into focused segments and providing brief assignments that ask students to reflect upon, apply, and check comprehension of course material. Second, combining regularly scheduled communication with flexible engagement opportunities helps to create a supportive learning environment. Third, the asynchronous approach is particularly well suited to writing-focused assignments, which can facilitate greater quantity and quality of interaction than face-to-face classes when structured effectively. Fourth, incorporating multi-dimensional materials from a variety of sources, viewpoints, and disciplines helps to build empathy, broaden perspectives, and encourage critical inquiry. Fifth, instructors can decentralize student engagement by incorporating small group assignments to help create community and build rapport. Sixth, online technologies should be used to their maximum benefit to engage students and unleash their creativity in new ways that further promote active learning. This framework was designed with undergraduate students in mind, but it can be adapted to high school and middle school levels. If synchronous online or face-to-face instruction is also important, elements of this framework can be fused with a ``flipped'' classroom model, where students engage with online materials outside of class and meet for a short period of time for live discussion or other activities.},

In this article, we highlight the problems for the profession of this sort of conceptual ambiguity, arguing that it is an ethical responsibility for the profession to gain clarity about the meaning and apt focus of our knowledge development initiatives. We parse out nursing and science as separate concepts and synthesize from this analysis a simple yet comprehensive definition of nursing science.

Using a domain perspective, a new taxonomy of approach to leadership is developed, and LMX is discussed within this taxonomy as a relationship-based approach to leadership. The taxonomy refers to 3 domains within the construct of leadership: leader, follower, and relationship. The controversy surrounding the question of the measurement and the dimensionality of the LMX construct is discussed. LMX has been theorized as containing 3 dimensions: respect, trust and obligation. Finally, LMX is argued to be both transactional and transformational. The authors conclude that greater attention to levels issue has increased the clarity, test ability, comprehensiveness, and creativity of the organizational theorizing.

  abstract = {An understanding of the nature and development of nursing intuition can help nurse educators foster it in young nurses and give clinicians more confidence in this aspect of their knowledge, allowing them to respond with greater assurance to their intuitions. In this paper, accounts from philosophy and neurophysiology are used to argue that intuition, specifically nursing intuition, is a valid form of knowledge. The paper argues that nursing intuition, a kind of practical intuition, is composed of four distinct aspects that include: (1) embodied knowledge rather like that knowledge we have when we have learned to ride a bicycle; (2) well-trained sensory perceptions attentive to subtle details of complex, often rapidly changing situations; (3) a significant store of pertinent conceptual knowledge; and (4) a history of habitual actions intentionally directed towards achieving the best outcomes for our patients. Contemporary neurophysiology research strongly suggests that human persons experience other persons such that they directly understand the meaning of a variety of different human actions, intentions, emotions, and sensations in immediate, non-reflective, and non-conceptual perceptions. This research is supported by the philosophical theories of Jacques Maritain and Yves R. Simon found in their accounts of practical knowledge. Together, these accounts offer us a rich view of the reality of nursing intuition that helps us understand why we find intuitive actions in some but not all nurses and gives us some specific information about how to develop intuition in young nurses. Finally, this research shows us a path for further research.},

  year = 2022,

  abstract = {One of the most recognized approaches of conflict negotiation in the world was developed by Roger Fisher and William Ury. Derived from studies conducted by the Harvard Negotiation Project, Fisher and Ury, provide a straightforward, step-by-step method for negotiating conflicts. This method, called principled negotiation, emphasizes deciding issues on their merits rather than through competitive haggling or through excessive accommodation. Principled negotiation shows you how to obtain your fair share decently and without having others take advantage of you. The Fisher and Ury negotiation method comprises four principles. Each principle directly focuses on one of the four basic elements of negotiation: people, interests, options, and criteria. Effective leaders frequently understand and utilize these four principles in conflict situations. To be effective in dealing with conflicts, both of the problem factor and the people factor need to be addressed. In particular, Fisher and Ury argue that the people factor needs to be separated out from the problem factor. Our personalities, beliefs, and values are intricately interwoven with our conflicts. However, principled negotiation says that people and the problem need to be disentangled. By separating people from the problem, we enable ourselves to recognize others' uniqueness. By focusing on the people aspect, we become more aware of the personalities and idiosyncratic needs of those with whom we are in conflict. The second principle, which is perhaps the most well known, emphasizes that parties in a conflict must focus on interests and not just positions. Positions represent our stand or perspective in a particular conflict. Interests represent what is behind our positions. Your position is something you have decided upon. Your interests are what caused you to so decide. Focusing on interests expands conflict negotiation by encouraging individuals to explore the unique underpinnings of the conflict.},

  abstract = {Team leaders and team members can use the model to help them make decisions about the current state of their team and the specific actions they need to take, if any, to improve the team's functioning. The model portrays leadership as a team oversight function in which the leader's role is to do whatever is necessary to help the team achieve effectiveness. The model provides the leader with a cognitive map for identifying team needs, and offers suggestions about how to take appropriate corrective actions. The model helps the leader make sense of the complexity of teams and offers practical suggestions based on theory and research. In using the model, the team leadership engages in the leader mediation process by deciding which option is most appropriate for the team: monitoring or taking action. If the monitoring reveals that all aspects of the team's functioning are satisfactory, then the leadership should not take any direct actions but continue to monitor the internal and external environments in terms of team performance and development. If monitoring reveals that action is needed, then the leadership decides whether to take an internal-level action or an external-level action or both. Finally, the leadership decides which action is appropriate to meet the needs of the team. Determining the exact intervention is not as easy as it sounds, however, and it clearly reflects the skills necessary for team leadership. In any case, the leader can decide to keep monitoring the situation and not take any immediate action because of the group's phase of development. Or the leader can decide at which level to intervene and then decide to enact the most appropriate leadership function at that level. The team leadership model aids in team analysis and improvement, much like that of sports teams.  By comparing their own teams with established standards or criteria of team excellence, leaders can determine the areas of greatest weakness that might need critical intervention.}

  abstract = {As a result of leadership failures in the public and private sectors, authentic leadership is emerging in response to societal demands for genuine, trustworthy, and good leadership. Authentic leadership describes leadership that is transparent, morally grounded, and responsive to people's needs and values. Even though authentic leadership is still in the early stages of development, the study of authentic leadership is timely and worthwhile, offering hope to people who long for true leadership. Although there is no single accepted definition of authentic leadership, it can be conceptualized intrapersonally, developmentally, and interpersonally. The intrapersonal perspective focuses on the leader and the leader's knowledge, self-regulation, and self-concept. The interpersonal perspective claims that authentic leadership is a collective process, created by leaders and followers together. The developmental perspective emphasizes major components of authentic leadership that develop over a lifetime and are triggered by major life events. The practical approach to authentic leadership provides basic ``how to'' steps to become an authentic leader. The approach identifies five basic dimensions of authentic leadership and the corresponding behavioral characteristics individuals need to develop to become authentic leaders. In the social science literature, a theoretical approach to authentic leadership is emerging. Drawing from the fields of leadership, positive organizational scholarship, and ethics, researchers have identified four major components of authentic leadership: self-awareness, internalized moral perspective, balanced processing, and relational transparency. In addition, researchers have found that authentic leadership is influenced by a leader's positive psychological capacities, moral reasoning, and critical life events. In summary, authentic leadership is a new and exciting area of research, which holds a great deal of promise. As more research is conducted on authentic leadership, a clearer picture will emerge about the true nature of the process and the assumptions and principles that it encompasses.}

In the article, in the second sentence of the third paragraph of the ``The Empirical Base for CBP'' section, ``construction of a life narrative'' should have read ``construction of a trauma narrative.'' The full corrected sentence follows: ``Therefore, the trauma treatment component traditionally focused upon construction of a trauma narrative must be expanded to address the effects of trauma on our clients' entire life narratives, including their development of a sense of self and social identity.''] This article provides the outline of a new framework for treating adult survivors of childhood emotional abuse and neglect. Component-based psychotherapy (CBP) is an evidence-informed model that bridges, synthesizes, and expands upon several existing schools, or theories, of treatment for adult survivors of traumatic stress. These include approaches to therapy that stem from more classic traditions in psychology, such as psychoanalysis, to more modern approaches including those informed by feminist thought. Moreover, CBP places particular emphasis on integration of key concepts from evidence-based treatment models developed in the past few decades predicated upon thinking and research on the effects of traumatic stress and processes of recovery for survivors.

Fewer theories have been derived from the study of healthy human beings, those who strive not so much to preserve life as to make it worth living. Thus we find... many studies of criminals, few of law-abiders; many of fear, few of courage; more on hostility than on affiliation; much on the blindness in man, little on his vision; much on his past, little on his outreaching into the future.'---Gordon Allport, 1955Originally the field of psychology had a threefold mission: to cure mental illness, yes, but also to find ways to make life fulfilling for all and to maximize talent. Over the last century, a focus on mental illness has often been prioritized over studies of health, to the point that many people assume'psychologist'is just another way of saying'psychotherapist.'This book is about one attempt to restore the discipline's larger mission.Positive psychology attends to what philosophers call'the good life.'It is about fostering strength and living well---about how to do a good job at being human. Some of that will involve cheerful emotions, and some of it will not. There are vital roles to be played by archetypal challenges such as those involving self-control, guilt, and grit, and even the terror of death enters into positive psychology's vision of human flourishing.Charles Hackney connects this still-new movement to foundational concepts in philosophy and Christian theology. He then explores topics such as subjective states, cognitive processes, and the roles of personality, relationships, and environment, also considering relevant practices in spheres from the workplace to the church and even the martial arts dojo. Hackney takes seriously the range of critiques positive psychology has faced as he frames a constructive future for Christian contributions to the field.Christian Association for Psychological Studies (CAPS) Books explore how Christianity relates to mental health and behavioral sciences including psychology, counseling, social work, and marriage and family therapy in order to equip Christian clinicians to support the well-being of their clients.},

  abstract = {HOW CAN HUMANITARIAN AID WORKERS BUILD RESILIENCE IN HIGH-STRESS ENVIRONMENTS? As a global society, we rely upon 570,000 humanitarian aid workers to bring security, comfort and basic services to more than 131 million people in need, including over 68 million refugees displaced by conflict and insecurity. Relief workers operating on the front lines of humanitarian response are routinely exposed to stress and chaos, and as a result, the sector continues to shoulder a largely overlooked mental health crisis. Working in countries affected by war and natural disasters is inherently stressful, yet aid workers also face a layer of psychological vulnerability which is exacerbated by the lack of adequate training, support and management for such issues. The failure to adequately prepare and support staff has enormous negative consequences at three levels: Individual humanitarian aid workers suffer increased trauma and stress levels, perform under their potential, get burned out and leave the field earlier. Humanitarian organisations operate less efficiently, with higher costs for insurance and medical care, and high staff turnover causing loss of institutional knowledge and inflated recruitment costs. Populations in need receive a lower quality of care from agencies with high staff turnover and aid workers who are over-stressed, less experienced and under-trained. Through this event, we explore more around the need for support amongst humanitarian aid workers in relation to stress management. We ask: what are the main stressors experienced by aid workers, and how does stress impact them? What are the potential routes to resilience, both at the individual and organisational level? What duty of care do organisations have in relation to the wellbeing of their staff? ABOUT THE SPEAKER Drawing on the experiences of local and international aid workers, Dr Dan Siegel provides an insight into the need for resilience in the caring professions. He explores how to move from a `No' brain state to a `Yes' brain state and how to promote wellbeing through greater awareness. Daniel J. Siegel, M.D., is a clinical professor of psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine and the founding co-director of the Mindful Awareness Research Center at UCLA. He is a New York Times Bestselling author and has published extensive written work. As one of the world's leading neuropsychiatrists, Dr Siegel focuses on exploring how human consciousness can evolve to meet the unprecedented challenges we face in today's world. He is Executive Director of the Mindsight Institute, which teaches insight, empathy and integration in individuals, families and communities.

  abstract = {Research on moral judgment has been dominated by rationalist models, in which moral judgment is thought to be caused by moral reasoning. The author gives 4 reasons for considering the hypothesis that moral reasoning does not cause moral judgment; rather, moral reasoning is usually a post hoc construction, generated after a judgment has been reached. The social intuitionist model is presented as an alternative to rationalist models. The model is a social model in that it deemphasizes the private reasoning done by individuals and emphasizes instead the importance of social and cultural influences. The model is an intuitionist model in that it states that moral judgment is generally the result of quick, automatic evaluations (intuitions). The model is more consistent than rationalist models with recent findings in social, cultural, evolutionary, and biological psychology, as well as in anthropology and primatology.},

Educators potentially have access to a variety of evidence and materials regarding good assessment practice but may not choose to consult them or be successful in translating these into practice. In this article, we propose a new challenge for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning: the need to study the disjunction between proposals for assessment ``best practice'' and assessment in practice by examining the assessment decision-making of teachers. We suggest that assessment decision-making involves almost all university teachers, occurs at multiple levels, and is influenced by expertise, trust, culture, and policy. Assessment may dictate the curriculum from the student's perspective, and we argue that assessment decision-making dictates assessment.},

A 4-part empirically based model is proposed to guide teaching and learning for critical thinking: (a) a dispositional component to prepare learners for effortful cognitive work, (b) instruction in the skills of critical thinking, (c) training in the structural aspects of problems and arguments to promote transcontextual transfer of critical-thinking skills, and (d) a metacognitive component that includes checking for accuracy and monitoring progress toward the goal.

Missing, however, has been any guidance as to what the product of these tools should be--or what actually constitutes a strategy. Strategy has become a catchall term used to mean whatever one wants it to mean. Executives now talk about their "service strategy," their "branding strategy," their "acquisition strategy," or whatever kind of strategy that is on their mind at a particular moment. But strategists--whether they are CEOs of established firms, division presidents, or entrepreneurs--must have a strategy, an integrated, overarching concept of how the business will achieve its objectives. If a business must have a single, unified strategy, then it must necessarily have parts. What are those parts? We present a framework for strategy design, arguing that a strategy has five elements, providing answers to five questions--arenas: where will we be active? vehicles: how will we get there? differentiators: how will we win in the marketplace? staging: what will be our speed and sequence of moves? economic logic: how will we obtain our returns? Our article develops and illustrates these domains of choice, particularly emphasizing how essential it is that they form a unified whole.},

This article describes the development and testing of a revised measure of moral distress, the Moral Distress Scale--Revised (MDS-R), designed for use in multiple health care settings and with multiple disciplines. Methods: After instrument development and content validity testing, a survey methodology was used to assess reliability and construct validity of the MDS-R. Registered nurses (n = 169) and physicians (n = 37) in eight intensive care units (ICUs) at an academic medical center in the southeastern United States participated; the survey was administered during a 2-week period in January 2011. Results: Adequate reliability and evidence of construct validity were demonstrated. Moral distress was significantly higher for nurses than physicians, although it was negatively correlated with ethical climate for both provider groups. MDS-R scores were significantly higher for those clinicians considering leaving their positions. The proportion of physicians and nurses who had left a previous position or who were considering leaving their current positions due to moral distress was high (16\% and 31\%, respectively). Conclusions: Initial testing of the MDS-R reveals promising evidence of instrument reliability and validity. The findings from this study lend further support to the important relationships between the moral distress of providers, the ethical climate of health care settings, and retention of health care professionals.},

The present study investigated work values, as measured by the Minnesota Importance Questionnaire, across three generations (Silent Generation, N = 371; Baby Boom, N = 1179; and Generation X, N = 139) while accounting for age. Results suggested that workers from the Silent Generation placed more importance on Status and Autonomy than did Baby Boom or Generation X workers. More recent generations (Baby Boom and Generation X) were found to place more importance on Working Conditions, Security, Coworkers, and Compensation.

Previous studies on the subject have been hampered by inadequate measures of teacher training and difficulties in addressing the non-random selection of teachers to students and of teachers to training. We address these issues by estimating models that include detailed measures of pre-service and in-service training, a rich set of time-varying covariates, and student, teacher, and school fixed effects. We find that elementary and middle school teacher productivity increases with experience (informal on-the-job training). The largest gains from experience occur in the first few years, but we find continuing gains beyond the first five years of a teacher's career. In contrast, we do not find a consistent relationship between formal professional development training and teacher productivity. However, this may be partly driven by estimation issues as we find more significant positive effects of formal training in the subject-grade combination where estimates should be most precise (middle school math). There is no evidence that teachers' pre-service (undergraduate) training or college entrance exam scores are related to productivity.},

Oberholzer-Gee is the author of the Harvard Business Review article ``Eliminate Strategic Overload'' (https://hbr.org/2021/05/eliminate-str...) as well as the book ``Better, Simpler Strategy: A Value-Based Guide to Exceptional Performance'' (https://www.amazon.com/Better-Simpler....

  abstract = {Online collaborative learning (OCL) based on the community of inquiry (CoI) framework is often implemented in the form of an online discussion activity for teaching subjects that require learners to revise understandings and invent ways to solve problems. However, implementing effective OCL for such a purpose is challenging due to the difficulty of fostering higher-level inquiry stages, which indicate deeper learning. Such an issue could hinder the effectiveness of the discussion and might lead to fewer transaction of ideas. Prior studies on OCL showed that facilitation strategies are insufficient for fostering higher-level inquiry stages. There is a need for an alternative strategy that could complement the existing approaches. Providing a preparatory activity that increases engagement with learning contents related to the discussion topic through a kit-build concept mapping (KBCM) activity could enable the participants to engage in a productive discussion by increasing their awareness of discussion-related concepts and their relationship. Such an activity may help the participants progress through the inquiry stages. This study aims to propose a preparatory activity for organizing knowledge using KBCM to support learners in advancing through practical inquiry stages during the discussion. The results show that participants who did KBCM showed a higher rate of triggering event, exploration, and integration compared to those who did summary writing. Therefore, providing KBCM as a preparatory activity has the potential to help learners progress through inquiry stages in a more productive way up until integration compared to the traditional method of reviewing materials through writing a structured summary.},

Its power is frequently mentioned in articles about learning and teaching, but surprisingly few recent studies have systematically investigated its meaning. This article provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and reviews the evidence related to its impact on learning and achievement. This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then proposed that identifies the particular properties and circumstances that make it effective, and some typically thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms.},

Past research in this area has predominantly focused on global cognitive evaluations of how one typically lives. Findings from such research lack practical relevance, and hence, this study aimed to investigate how actual hedonic and eudaimonic behaviour related to well-being and psychopathology. Participants (N = 105) completed an array of well-being outcomes prior to completing an online diary, reporting actual instances of hedonic and eudaimonic behaviour. Participants spent more time engaged in hedonic activity than eudaimonic activity. Hedonic activity served an emotion regulation function, predicting positive affect, carefreeness, vitality, and life satisfaction. Hedonic behaviour also predicted reduced negative affect, depression, and stress. Eudaimonic behaviour predicted meaning in life and elevating experience. Both hedonic and eudaimonic behaviours predicted flourishing. These findings suggest that increasing hedonic and eudaimonic behaviours may be an effective way to increase well-being and reduce psychological distress.

  year = 2013,

  abstract = {Every culture has a way of perceiving and practicing marriage. Many contemporary Western Christians mistake what their culture prescribes regarding marriage with what the Bible portrays, and thereby take as biblical what is merely cultural. Uncritical conformity to cultural imperatives of marriage then becomes a Christian virtue, and a sweet surrender. Few recognize, much less question this confusion, even when its consequences are unhealthy. In Sweet Surrender Dennis Hiebert challenges Christians to comprehend what is cultural in their view of marriage, hold as optional what is not explicitly required by the Bible, and live out their marriages within the transcendent grace of God. Gaining greater awareness can free marriages from the control of culture for something more simply but deeply Christian. Marriages benefit when they are released from cultural directives that are not biblical callings, even if they choose to retain them as cultural practices. This book is for Christians who are ready to rethink their assumptions about marriage."Contemplating marriage is, itself, an act of courageous and intelligent cultural engagement, and Dennis Hiebert serves as an expert guide. Sweet Surrender will help readers think anew about what marriage, intimacy, sex, and love mean in various cultural contexts."--Jenell Paris, Professor of Anthropology, Messiah College"In this biblically informed book, Hiebert utilizes the concept of sweet surrender to describe the less than healthy way in which biblical ideals for marriage are surrendered to contemporary socio-cultural norms. This insightful book is timely for both [married] individuals and those attempting to understand the complexity of marriage in a postmodern society with competing systems of moral structure. . . . I strongly recommend this book for Christian leaders, teachers, or anyone else who wants [to] understand how the biblical essence of marriage can be recaptured in contemporary society."--Jack Balswick, Senior Professor of Sociology and Family Development, Fuller Theological Seminary"Dennis Hiebert offers a provoking challenge to contemporary ideas (Christian and secular) about marriage. From mate selection to intimacy, Dennis suggests 'mandates' we hold about marriage are less biblical than cultural, more influenced by Western individualism than Christian truth. Rather than offering another inspiring read of what marriage can be, Sweet Surrender provides a corrective to unrealistic expectations couples hold for this ever-changing institution."--Lisa Graham McMinn, Writer in Residence, George Fox UniversityDennis Hiebert, PhD, is Professor of Sociology at Providence University College in Canada, where he has taught courses in Marriage and Family for over twenty years. A former president of the Association of Christians Teaching Sociology, he has authored numerous academic articles on the intersection of Christianity and sociology. Dennis and his wife live in southern Manitoba and have two adult sons.},

Aspiring helping professionals will learn the theoretical principles behind the three-stage model and fundamental clinical skills for working with diverse clients. Hill also challenges students to think critically about the helping process, their own biases, and what approach best aligns with their therapeutic skills and goals.New to this edition are:detailed guidelines for developing and revising case conceptualizations,expanded coverage of cultural awareness,updated case examples that reflect greater diversity among clients and helpers, andadditional strategies for addressing therapeutic challenges.},

The authors sought to examine the lived experience of gratitude as it arises in a transpersonal context. Drawing from interviews with 68 adults, the authors generated 110 items. In two separate studies (n = 314; n = 385) the authors culled the scale to sixteen items by using a combination of Cronbach's alpha, exploratory factor analysis, and assessments of content validity. Internal consistency for the overall scale and the subscales was high with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.88. A confirmatory factor analysis revealed strong fit indices for the factor structure. The final scale exhibited good convergent validity, as quantified by positive correlations with positive reciprocity, grateful disposition, empathy, and spiritual transcendence. In addition, the final scale exhibited good discriminant validity, as quantified by negative correlations with negative reciprocity. These results indicate that our assessment of gratitude is similar to previous assessments of gratitude, but also distinct from scales that quantify negative reciprocity. Conclusions are drawn regarding the theoretical structure of gratitude and the importance of adding a transpersonal and spiritual dimension to the construct.

For governments, reconciling the implications of digitalization with the functional performance of diplomacy is essential to achieving global and national needs. Brian Hocking and Jan Melissen argue that digital diplomacy is more than the application of social media to familiar diplomatic functions, even though the challenge of their use in diplomacy should not be underestimated. Foreign ministries have no choice but to develop digital strategies if they are to survive. Digitalization will enhance the need for them to redefine their roles and to develop narratives to explain what they are for. The conventional wisdom is that digitalization does not change the fundamental objectives of diplomacy, but offers new ways through which these can be achieved. Governments need to take a more nuanced look: digitalization will put fundamental norms and rules of diplomacy to the test. Diplomats of all types will need to function in the offline and online environments. Foreign ministries are advised not to respond to the challenges of the digital age by `following the herd'. They should not treat digital resources as another form of top-down communication, and define their objectives clearly.},

However, the varied belief systems and worldviews held among adherents of distinct Christian traditions may interfere with practical collaborative efforts between PP and Christianity. In this chapter, we explore important considerations for effective collaboration between PP and Christianity. Namely, we argue that Christianity can provide a framework for what individuals should value and what virtues a person should pursue, whereas PP can provide the tools and methodology for how to pursue the goals that are identified by Christianity. We first review the geographic distribution and demographic composition of Christians around the world, emphasizing the value of context when working with Christian populations. Second, we highlight fundamental beliefs and values that may influence how Christians interpret and utilize empirical findings from the field of PP. Third, we discuss how Christian beliefs, traditions, and doctrines influence our understandings of well-being, health, and virtue development. Throughout the chapter, we discuss strategies and implications for positive collaboration between the fields of PP and Christianity.},

One worry is that the laws of physics, plus facts about the past over which we have no control, determine what we will do, and that means we're not free. Another worry is that because the laws and the past determine what we'll do, someone smart enough could know what we would do ahead of time, so we can't be free.

Therefore, evidence suggesting access to healthcare is problematic for many Indigenous peoples is concerning. While biomedical perspectives underlie our current understanding of access, considering alternate perspectives could expand our awareness of and ability to address this issue. In this paper, we critique how access to healthcare is understood through a biomedical lens, how a postcolonial theoretical lens can extend that understanding, and the subsequent implications this alternative view raises for the nursing profession. Drawing on peer-reviewed published and gray literature concerning healthcare access and Indigenous peoples to inform this critique, we focus on the underlying theoretical lens shaping our current understanding of access. A postcolonial analysis provides a way of understanding healthcare as a social space and social relationship, presenting a unique perspective on access to healthcare. The novelty of this finding is of particular importance for the profession of nursing, as we are well situated to influence these social aspects, improving access to healthcare services broadly, and among Indigenous peoples specifically.},

A confirmatory factor analysis was performed using these nine items to validate our proposed Abbreviated Self-Leadership Questionnaire (ASLQ).

None-theless, these massive open online learning communities regularly draw far more engaged users than the typical MOOC. Their informal structure, however, makes them significantly more difficult to study. In this work, we take a first step toward attempting to understand these communi-ties specifically from the perspective of scale. Taking a sample of 62 such communities, we develop a tagging sys-tem for understanding the specific features and how they relate to scale. For example, just as a MOOC cannot man-ually grade every assignment, so also an informal learning community cannot approve every contribution; and just as MOOCs therefore employ autograding, informal learning communities employ crowd-sourced moderation or plat-form-driven enforcement. Using these tags, we then select several communities for deeper case studies. We also use these tags to make sense of learning-based subreddits from the popular community site Reddit, which offers an API for programmatic analysis. Based on these techniques, we offer findings about the performance of informal learning communities at scale and issue a call to include these envi-ronments more fully in future research on learning at scale.},

  abstract = {Interest in eudaimonia (e.g., growth, meaning, authenticity, excellence) and its distinction from hedonia (e.g., pleasure, enjoyment, comfort, absence of distress) is growing rapidly, as researchers recognize that both concepts are central to the study of well-being. Yet research on these concepts faces challenges as well: findings based on different operationalizations can be quite discrepant; definitions of eudaimonia and hedonia sometimes fall into different categories of analysis (e.g. when eudaimonia is described as a way of functioning, hedonia as an experience); and the terms eudaimonia and hedonia are sometimes defined vaguely or applied to concepts that may be mere correlates. To aid in addressing these challenges, we propose the following terminology and classification for discussing conceptual and operational definitions: (1) degree of centrality---differentiating concepts that are core (i.e., definitional), close-to-core (i.e., given some attention but not central), and major correlates; (2) category of analysis---identifying which of the following categories a definition represents: (a) orientations (orientations, values, motives, and goals), (b) behaviors (behavioral content, activity characteristics), (c) experiences (subjective experiences, emotions, cognitive appraisals), (d) functioning (indices of positive psychological functioning, mental health, flourishing); and (3) level of measurement---identifying whether a definition is used for trait and/or state comparisons. The work of scholars with a program of research on eudaimonia or the distinction between eudaimonia and hedonia is reviewed and discussed within the framework of the proposed classification; several points of convergence and divergence across definitions are highlighted; and important questions and directions for future research are identified.},

  abstract = {In computing, a hyperlink, or simply a link, is a digital reference providing direct access to data by a user's clicking or tapping. A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document. Hypertext is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked from is known as anchor text. A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a hypertext system, and to create a hyperlink is to hyperlink (or simply to link). A user following hyperlinks is said to navigate or browse the hypertext. The document containing a hyperlink is known as its source document. For example, in content from Wikipedia or Google Search, many words and terms in the text are hyperlinked to definitions of those terms. Hyperlinks are often used to implement reference mechanisms such as tables of contents, footnotes, bibliographies, indexes, and glossaries. In some hypertext, hyperlinks can be bidirectional: they can be followed in two directions, so both ends act as anchors and as targets. More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links. The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the World Wide Web most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new tab).

  year = 2025,

  abstract = {Identity theft, identity piracy or identity infringement occurs when someone uses another's personal identifying information, like their name, identifying number, or credit card number, without their permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. The term identity theft was coined in 1964. Since that time, the definition of identity theft has been legally defined throughout both the UK and the U.S. as the theft of personally identifiable information. Identity theft deliberately uses someone else's identity as a method to gain financial advantages or obtain credit and other benefits. The person whose identity has been stolen may suffer adverse consequences, especially if they are falsely held responsible for the perpetrator's actions. Personally identifiable information generally includes a person's name, date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, bank account or credit card numbers, PINs, electronic signatures, fingerprints, passwords, or any other information that can be used to access a person's financial resources. Determining the link between data breaches and identity theft is challenging, primarily because identity theft victims often do not know how their personal information was obtained. According to a report done for the FTC, identity theft is not always detectable by the individual victims. Identity fraud is often but not necessarily the consequence of identity theft. Someone can steal or misappropriate personal information without then committing identity theft using the information about every person, such as when a major data breach occurs. A U.S. Government Accountability Office study determined that "most breaches have not resulted in detected incidents of identity theft". The report also warned that "the full extent is unknown". A later unpublished study by Carnegie Mellon University noted that "Most often, the causes of identity theft is not known", but reported that someone else concluded that "the probability of becoming a victim to identity theft as a result of a data breach is ... around only 2\%". For example, in one of the largest data breaches which affected over four million records, it resulted in only about 1,800 instances of identity theft, according to the company whose systems were breached. An October 2010 article entitled "Cyber Crime Made Easy" explained the level to which hackers are using malicious software. As Gunter Ollmann, Chief Technology Officer of security at Microsoft, said, "Interested in credit card theft?  There's an app for that."  This statement summed up the ease with which these hackers are accessing all kinds of information online. The new program for infecting users' computers was called Zeus, and the program is so hacker-friendly that even an inexperienced hacker can operate it. Although the hacking program is easy to use, that fact does not diminish the devastating effects that Zeus (or other software like Zeus) can do on a computer and the user.  For example, programs like Zeus can steal credit card information, important documents, and even documents necessary for homeland security. If a hacker were to gain this information, it would mean nationwide identity theft or even a possible terrorist attack. The ITAC said that about 15 million Americans had their identity stolen in 2012.},

So the moment we learn about a new ministry or strategy and see its effect in another church, we run to implement it in our own. Unfortunately, this impulse is usually met by opposition, skepticism, and ultimately, rejection.What if the solution isn't a new model or a complicated strategy, but a shift in perspective? What if you could keep your church's current vision, values, and model, and simply make a few micro-shifts...leading to macro-changes?This book explores five micro-shifts that have the potential to produce macro-changes in your church. As you read, you will discover how to integrate these micro-shifts into the life of your church, starting with the way you disciple. You will finish by developing a plan to structure, communicate, and evaluate these changes to ensure that they take root and pave the way for lasting change and kingdom impact.},

We integrate Derrida's ethics of hospitality framework with a focus on practices of hospitality, including its affective and material, embodied dimension (Zembylas: Stud Philos Educ 39:37-50, 2019). This article offers empirical examples of practices of what we termed 'virtual academic hospitality': during a series of online collaborative and cross borders workshops with teachers of English based in the Gaza Strip (Palestine), we performed academic hospitality through virtual convivial rituals and the sharing of virtual gifts, which are illustrated here. We propose a revision of the concept of academic hospitality arguing that: firstly, academic hospitality is not limited to intellectual conversations; secondly, that the relationship between hospitality and mobility needs to be revised, since hospitality mediated by the technological medium can be performed, and technology may even stretch hospitality towards the unreachable 'unconditional hospitality' theorised by Derrida (Of hospitality: Anne Dufourmantelle invited Jacques Derrida to respond. Stanford University Press, Stanford, 2000); and thirdly, that indigenous epistemics, with their focus on the affective, may offer alternative understandings of conviviality within the academy. These points may contribute to the collective development of a new paradigmatic understanding of hospitality, one which integrates Western and indigenous traditions of hospitality, and which includes the online environment.},

The app delivering these services was renamed Free Basics in September 2015. As of April 2018, 100 million people were using internet.org. It has been criticized for violating net neutrality, and by handpicking internet services that are included, for discriminating against companies not in the list, including competitors of Meta Platforms' subsidiary Facebook. In February 2016, regulators banned the Free Basics service in India based on "Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations". The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) accused Facebook of failing to pass on the four questions in the regulator's consultation paper and also blocking access to TRAI's designated email for feedback on Free Basics. On February 11, 2016, Facebook withdrew the Free Basics platform from India. In July 2017, Global Voices published the widespread report "Free Basics in Real Life" analyzing its practices in Africa, Asia and Latin America, and concluding it violates net neutrality, focuses on "Western corporate content", and overall "it's not even very helpful".},

This comprehensive and accessible guide introduces students to the field and encourages knowledge of research ethics in practice. Research Ethics for Social Scientists sets out to do four things: The first is to demonstrate the practical value of thinking seriously and systematically about what constitutes ethical conduct in social science research. Secondly, the text identifies how and why current regulatory regimes have emerged. Thirdly, it seeks to reveal those practices that have contributed to the adversarial relationships between researchers and regulators. Finally, the book hopes to encourage both parties to develop shared solutions to ethical and regulatory problems. Research Ethics for Social Scientists is an excellent introductory text for students as it: - introduces students to ethical theory and philosophy; - provides practical guidance on what ethical theory means for research practice; - provides case studies to give real examples of ethics in research action. The result is an informative, accessible and practical guide to research ethics for any student or researcher in the social sciences.},

  abstract = {AIM: This paper explores the invisibility and underrepresentation of Black nurses in formal and informal leadership roles using a Black feminist poststructuralist framework. The paper describes historical and contemporary challenges experienced by Black nurses throughout their nursing education and in practice. It also highlights how social and institutional discourses continue to marginalise and oppress Black nurses as leaders and render them invisible. BACKGROUND: Diversity among nursing leaders is essential to inform health care delivery, develop inclusive practices and provide culturally sensitive care. Despite this glaring need for diversity within nursing in Canada, there remains a significant underrepresentation of Black nurses in the workforce and as leaders. DESIGN: This is a discursive paper on Black nurses in nursing education and the workforce as well as their location as leaders in health care through a critical analysis using Black feminist poststructuralism. METHODS: A review of the literature involved searching electronic databases CINAHL, NovaNet, PubMed and Google Scholar using keywords including: Black; African; Nurses; Leaders; Feminism; Poststructural. Articles were screened by titles and abstracts before accessing full-text for relevant articles. RESULTS: Black feminist poststructuralism uncovers how power, language, subjectivity and agency are constructed by the historically ingrained social and institutional discourses of everyday life for Black nurses. Experiences of discrimination and oppression were common throughout nursing education and practice for Black nurses, resulting in feelings of marginalisation and isolation. CONCLUSION: The invisibility of Black nurse leaders is the result of generational oppression and discrimination manifested through discourses. Systemic, institutional and historical discourses perpetuate barriers for Black nurse leaders, resulting in their invisibility or absence in practice. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This paper is designed to generate discussion related to the invisibility of Black nurse leaders by providing an understanding of the historical experiences of Black people, their entry into the nursing profession and the present day challenges they face. This discussion will inform health care practice, policy, and structuring by identifying the barriers to leadership for Black nurses.},

  abstract = {Gonadal hormones contribute to the sexual differentiation of brain and behavior throughout the lifespan, from initial neural patterning to ``activation'' of adult circuits. Sexual behavior is an ideal system in which to investigate the mechanisms underlying hormonal activation of neural circuits. Sexual behavior is a hormonally regulated, innate social behavior found across species. Although both sexes seek out and engage in sexual behavior, the specific actions involved in mating are sexually dimorphic. Thus, the neural circuits mediating sexual motivation and behavior in males and females are overlapping yet distinct. Furthermore, sexual behavior is strongly dependent on circulating gonadal hormones in both sexes. There has been significant recent progress on elucidating how gonadal hormones modulate physiological properties within sexual behavior circuits with consequences for behavior. Therefore, in this mini-review we review the neural circuits of male and female sexual motivation and behavior, from initial sensory detection of pheromones to the extended amygdala and on to medial hypothalamic nuclei and reward systems. We also discuss how gonadal hormones impact the physiology and functioning of each node within these circuits. By better understanding the myriad of ways in which gonadal hormones impact sexual behavior circuits, we can gain a richer and more complete appreciation for the neural substrates of complex behavior.},

  abstract = {With the gradual shift to online education models that has taken place in recent decades, research has sought to understand the nuances of student performance in an online model in comparison to more traditional in-person modalities. However, the effects of instructional modality have been difficult to determine given the many variables that exist in course design between these methods. In this study, we attempt to determine the efficacy of asynchronous online instruction by comparing two nearly equivalent courses. The first course was a flipped classroom, a recent and well-studied hybrid model of instruction. The second was an asynchronous fully online course that contained all the same instructional elements as the in-person course but lacked any student or instructor interaction. Student performance was tracked at both a highly-selective private institution and an open-enrollment public institution. Results show that students' performance drops in an asynchronous online course compared to an equivalent in-person experience. Several potential hypotheses are put forth to explain a change in performance that can potentially shape the design of online instruction.},

  abstract = {"Debates about the role and nature of the state are at the heart of modern politics. However, the state itself remains notoriously difficult to define, and the term is subject to a range of different interpretations. In this book, distinguished state theorist Bob Jessop provides a critical introduction to the state as both a concept and a reality. He lucidly guides readers through all the major accounts of the state, and examines competing efforts to relate the state to other features of social organization. Essential themes in the analysis of the state are explored in full, including state formation, periodization, the re-scaling of the state and the state's future. Throughout, Jessop clearly defines key terms, from hegemony and coercion to government and governance. He also analyses what we mean when we speak about 'normal' and 'exceptional' states, and states that are 'failed' or 'rogue'. Combining an accessible style with expert sensitivity to the complexities of the state, this short introduction will be core reading for students and scholars of politics and sociology, as well as anyone interested in the changing role of the state in contemporary societies"--},

At times we may take certain liberties when interpreting some of this work, as we endeavor to attend to the focus of the current text (i.e., cognition and suicide). For example, this chapter began with the story of a young Shneidman wandering through the vault of the coroner's office considering the potential importance of researching suicide notes. As noted, this fateful spark of a research idea ignited an entire field of study and spurred a larger movement in society--that we should earnestly, purposefully, and methodically endeavor to prevent the tragedy of suicide. Beyond this aspect, however, the importance of the Shneidman and Farberow studies of suicide notes cannot be overstated. For what are suicide notes if not the final psychological considerations, musings, feelings, requests, communications, thoughts--cognitions--of the suicidal person? As a written testament to an individual's tragic suicidal end, the study of suicide notes historically marked a significant beginning for the study of suicide as a larger field and, as we shall see, it also fundamentally shaped Shneidman's thinking and views on the topic of suicide. To that end, we explore some of Shneidman's key theoretical, empirical, and clinical contributions to historic as well as contemporary suicidology.

In each case the contributors seek to explain how theory can translate into real-life counseling scenarios.This book builds on the framework of Eric L. Johnson's Psychology Christianity: Five Views. These include the Levels-of-Explanation Approach, the Integration Approach, the Christian Psychology Approach, the Transformational Approach and the Biblical Counseling Approach. While Counseling and Christianity can be used independently of Johnson's volume, the two can also function as useful companions.Christians who counsel, both those in practice and those still in training, will be served by this volume as it strengthens the connections between theory and practice in relating our faith to the mental health disciplines. They will finally get an answer to their persistent but unanswered question: "What would that counseling view look like behind closed doors?"Christian Association for Psychological Studies (CAPS) Books explore how Christianity relates to mental health and behavioral sciences including psychology, counseling, social work, and marriage and family therapy in order to equip Christian clinicians to support the well-being of their clients.},

  abstract = {In this latest installment to his series of best-selling self-reflection guides, celebrated educator, author, and motivational speaker Baruti Kafele offers school leaders 35 thought-provoking questions to ponder from one fundamental overarching query:'Is my school a better school because I lead it?'Musing deeply on discrete leadership matters is an essential component of success for anybody overseeing the day-to-day operations of a school, and doubly so in communities plagued by drugs, violence, or other markers of societal dysfunction. In this book, Kafele offers those seeking to improve the quality of instruction in their institutions hard-won wisdom on such critical issues as ensuring an optimal culture and climate, engaging in parent and community outreach, confirming emergency preparedness, rallying staff, and much more. Because the sheer volume of responsibilities for a principal or assistant principal can leave you with very little time for developing an effective and consistent self-reflection regimen, Kafele has done the work for you. You need only open the book and begin reading to embark upon a penetratingly insightful journey destined to transform your practice, boost teacher satisfaction, and---most important of all---inspire students to excel academically.},

Social justice nursing is defined by the editors as nursing practice that is emancipatory and rests on the principle of praxis which is practice aimed at attaining social justice goals and outcomes that improve health experiences and conditions of individuals, their communities, and society. There is a lack in the nursing discipline of resources that contain praxis approaches and there is a need for new concepts, models, and theories that could encompass scholarship and practice aimed at purposive reformation of nursing, other health professions, and health care systems. Chapters bridge critical theoretical frameworks and nursing science in ways that are understandable and useful for practicing nurses and other health professionals in clinical settings, in academia, and in research.In this book, nurses'ideas and knowledge development efforts are not limited to problems and solutions emerging from the dominant discourse or traditions. The authors offer innovative ways to work towards establishing alternative forms of knowledge, capable of capturing both the roots and complexity of contemporary problems as distributed across a diversity of people and communities. It fills a significant gap in the literature and makes an exceptional contribution as a collection of new writings from some of the foremost nursing scholars whose works are informed by critical frameworks.},

How can marketing be considered simple when there are so many different tools and platforms available?  So many different demographics to communicate with?  And the speed at which the marketing space evolves?  Surely marketing is not simple. This episode's guest, Allan Dib is confident that he can simplify marketing for any business and has even developed a 'One Page Marketing Plan Canvas' (https://successwise.com/) that business owners can access for free.           On The Dent Podcast, we interview key people of influence in all walks of life. We delve deep to unearth how these successful people got to where they are, their trials and tribulations, as well as their successes, and what their experiences can teach us all.   Allan Dib is the founder of Succeswise, a serial entrepreneur, rebellious marketer, and the bestselling author of The 1-Page Marketing Plan.  With over  20 years experience as an entrepreneur, Allan has built several multi-million dollar businesses in the IT, telecommunications, and marketing fields.   Here's a taste of Allan Dib and Glen Carlson's conversation - Allan breaks down his entrepreneurial journey, including how he taught himself marketing through a trial and error approach How Allan made marketing simple by developing a guide that allows business owners to create their own one page marketing plan Recognising that however specialized or niche your skills may be; that there will always be a target group out there willing to pay you for your knowledge and products How coaching can assist any business to grow beyond a plateau by providing a viewing point into the business for someone outside of it Why publishing books is still relevant in the marketing space in 2022 How to acquire and continue to accumulate value, credibility and authority in your field of expertise Marketing alternatives for those who do not want to be a face for their brand Allan explains how businesses can utilize his one page marketing plan canvas and how to download the canvas for free from successwise.com Allan shares some of the tech tools that he is using everyday in his business, including a CRM system},

Data can then be retrieved by the person operating the logging program. A keystroke recorder or keylogger can be either software or hardware. While the programs themselves are legal, with many designed to allow employers to oversee the use of their computers, keyloggers are most often used for stealing passwords and other confidential information. Keystroke logging can also be utilized to monitor activities of children in schools or at home and by law enforcement officials to investigate malicious usage.    Keylogging can also be used to study keystroke dynamics or human-computer interaction. Numerous keylogging methods exist, ranging from hardware and software-based approaches to acoustic cryptanalysis.},

Why did a top White House official decide to come clean and accept a prison sentence during Watergate? Why did a finance executive turn down millions out of respect for her employer? Why are some willing to risk their futures to uphold principles? What gives us the strength to stand up for what we believe?As these questions suggest, the topic of moral courage is front and center in today's culture. Enron, Arthur Andersen, the U.S. Olympic Committee, abusive priests, cheating students, domestic violence -- all these remind us that taking ethical stands should be a higher priority in our culture. Why, when people discern wrongdoing, are they sometimes unready, unable, or unwilling to act?In a book rich with examples, Rushworth Kidder reveals that moral courage is the bridge between talking ethics and doing ethics. Defining it as a readiness to endure danger for the sake of principle, he explains that the courage to act is found at the intersection of three elements: action based on core values, awareness of the risks, and a willingness to endure necessary hardship. By exploring how moral courage spurs us to strive for core values, he demonstrates the benefits of ethical action to the individual and to society -- and the severe consequences that can result from remaining morally dormant.Moral Courage puts indispensable concepts and tools into our hands, equipping us to respond to the increasingly complicated moral challenges we face at work, at home, and in our communities. It enables us to make clear, confident decisions by exploring some litmus-test questions:Is the benefit worth the risk?Am I motivated by my desire to uphold my beliefs or just to impose them on others?Will my actions create collateral damage among those with no stake in the outcome?While physical courage may no longer be a necessary survival skill or an essential rite of passage out of childhood, few would dispute the growing need for moral courage as the true gauge of maturity. Treating this subject not as an esoteric branch of philosophy but as a practical necessity for modern life, Kidder deftly leads us to a clear understanding of what moral courage is, what it does, and how to get it.},

Following this, the article examines some of the common problems encountered in virtual team working. It discusses two broad classes of solutions. The first are solutions that are essentially technical in nature (i.e., where changes to or improvements in technology would help to solve or ameliorate the problem); the second are more organizationally based (i.e., where the root of the problem is in people and how they are managed). The article concludes that both the technical and the organizational solutions need to be considered in parallel if an attempt to build an effective virtual team is to be successful.},

Through an analysis of 863 peer-reviewed positive psychology articles, this review attempts to map the international landscape of positive psychology research. Further, it responds to relevant critiques of the field, confirming some and dispelling others.

The SD model is also applied in an introductory organic chemistry course using Discord, a channel-based social media platform. By engaging students with tutors and discussion questions, we successfully catalyzed the formation of a student learning community, with the Discord server accumulating an average of 86 messages per week in a 13-week period, with students commenting that they felt less intimidated to ask questions in the server.},

With the aim of contributing to a critical dialogue on discourses of social justice in nursing, we explore contemporary theories of social justice and their move beyond a distributive paradigm, employing techniques of replication and critique of social justice discourses in nursing. We consider how postcolonial feminist theory can help us understand the relevance of more recent critical interpretations of social justice, particularly in reinterpreting and broadening nursing's individualistic focus on social justice so that due consideration and actions are directed toward the intersecting impact of historically and socially mediated conditions on health and human suffering.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nursing theories have attempted to shape the everyday practice of clinical nurses and patient care. However, many theories-because of their level of abstraction and distance from everyday caring activity-have failed to help nurses undertake the routine practical aspects of nursing care in a theoretically informed way. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the paper is to present a point-of-care theoretical framework, called the fundamentals of care (FOC) framework, which explains, guides, and potentially predicts the quality of care nurses provide to patients, their carers, and family members. DISCUSSION: The theoretical framework is presented: person-centered fundamental care (PCFC)-the outcome for the patient and the nurse and the goal of the FOC framework are achieved through the active management of the practice process, which involves the nurse and the patient working together to integrate three core dimensions: establishing the nurse-patient relationship, integrating the FOC into the patient's care plan, and ensuring that the setting or context where care is transacted and coordinated is conducive to achieving PCFC outcomes. Each dimension has multiple elements and subelements, which require unique assessment for each nurse-patient encounter. IMPLICATIONS: The FOC framework is presented along with two scenarios to demonstrate its usefulness. The dimensions, elements, and subelements are described, and next steps in the development are articulated.},

However, substantial research finds that accurate perspective taking is the exception rather than the norm. Although errors in perspective taking are common, little is known about their consequences. Is it worse to overestimate or to underestimate other people's emotional responses? Seven experiments find that underestimating the intensity of other people's emotional responses leads to more negative evaluations than overestimating others' emotions (Experiments 1--5). These results replicate across emotional valence and across observers and targets and occur because people believe that underestimation is indicative of lower effort and empathy in trying to understand the target. Additional experiments identify moderators of these effects, including stereotypical emotions and socially undesirable emotions (Experiments 6--7). The cost of errors in affective perspective taking is asymmetric, leading to important implications for social coordination.},

It is based on a systematic review of original data-based quantitative research published in peer-reviewed journals between 1872 and 2010, including a few seminal articles published since 2010. First, I provide a brief historical background to set the stage. Then I review research on R/S and mental health, examining relationships with both positive and negative mental health outcomes, where positive outcomes include well-being, happiness, hope, optimism, and gratefulness, and negative outcomes involve depression, suicide, anxiety, psychosis, substance abuse, delinquency/crime, marital instability, and personality traits (positive and negative). I then explain how and why R/S might influence mental health. Next, I review research on R/S and health behaviors such as physical activity, cigarette smoking, diet, and sexual practices, followed by a review of relationships between R/S and heart disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer{$\prime$}s disease and dementia, immune functions, endocrine functions, cancer, overall mortality, physical disability, pain, and somatic symptoms. I then present a theoretical model explaining how R/S might influence physical health. Finally, I discuss what health professionals should do in light of these research findings and make recommendations in this regard.},

While school professionals often lack basic specific evidence-based knowledge and skills to identify and intervene with students at risk for mental illness, they also lack the personal resources to understand their own mental health concerns which include how to effectively cope with job stress, while increasing teaching effectiveness and job satisfaction. Therefore, there is a call for a paradigm shift at the preservice level to better prepare all school-based personnel, including teachers, administrators, counselors, psychologists, social workers and nurses to proactively confront the mental health challenges of today's youth and the difficulties they face in serving those students. In this article, the authors provide evidence to illustrate the need for training in the area of preventative strengths-based mental health. Traditional training programs designed for school-based personnel are discussed, followed by suggestions for the implementation of strengths-based performance standards for all individuals preparing to work in the school environment. Finally, an innovative online graduate degree program, located at a unique university-based center dedicated to implementing a prevention, strengths-based mental health approach to educating school personnel, is discussed.},

Therefore, this meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of VRET for PTSD as compared to waitlist and active comparators. A literature search yielded nine controlled studies encompassing 296 participants (124 VRET, 172 controls). The differences between conditions regarding the primary outcome of PTSD symptom severity and the secondary outcome of depressive and anxiety symptoms post-treatment were calculated using Hedges' g. Compared to waitlist controls, VRET showed a significantly better outcome for PTSD symptoms (g =~0.62, p =~.017) and depressive symptoms (g =~0.50, p =~.008). There was no significant difference between VRET and active comparators regarding PTSD symptoms (g =~0.25, p =~.356) and depressive symptoms (g =~0.24, p =~.340) post-treatment. No significant effects emerged for anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest that VRET may be as effective as active comparators for PTSD patients. However, the results must be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of trials and the substantial number of -- predominantly male -- military service members studied. Additional controlled trials, considering a wider range of trauma types and balanced gender, are required to strengthen the evidence., {$\bullet$} There was evidence of a medium sized effect for VRET over WL for PTSD and depression.{$\bullet$} No significant difference between VRET and active controls in reducing PTSD symptoms.{$\bullet$} Results indicate no significant changes in anxiety after VRET.},

Drawing on over a decade of research and first-hand reporting with dozens of top action and adventure sports athletes like big wave legend Laird Hamilton, big mountain snowboarder Jeremy Jones, and skateboarding pioneer Danny Way, Kotler explores the frontier science of ``flow,'' an optimal state of consciousness in which we perform and feel our best. Building a bridge between the extreme and the mainstream, The Rise of Superman explains how these athletes are using flow to do the impossible and how we can use this information to radically accelerate performance in our own lives. At its core, this is a book about profound possibility; about what is actually possible for our species; about where---if anywhere---our limits lie.},

  abstract = {Abstract Research on comparative efficacy of media has been flawed, giving a false impression of equipotentiality between media. Consequently, the need for workable criteria for optimal media deployment has been underestimated. A framework is proposed to help course developers design such media selection procedures. This has two ingredients: a broad categorisation of comparative merits of different media and a finer-grained inventory of media-distinctive techniques and teaching functions. Five media are considered in depth: radio and TV (broadcast), audio and video (cassette, with complementary notes) and print. These are then compared briefly with computer-based media. The analysis considers six types of media characteristics: symbol system, access, controllability, student reactivity, interactivity, adaptivity. The framework was developed collaboratively over several years, with the help of theorists and practitioners in international seminars and workshops.}

Recognizing that each form of destructive leadership currently studied (e.g., abusive supervision, petty tyranny, and pseudo-transformational leadership) addresses aspects of destructive leadership but fails to capture the complete picture of the phenomenon, we clarify the boundaries among the constructs studied within the domain of destructive leadership, address some ambiguities about the nature of destructive leadership, make explicit some characteristics of destructive leadership that set it apart from other forms of leading, and integrate this thinking into a theoretical model that helps us understand the manifestations of destructive leadership, and their antecedents and consequences.},

Aristotle follows Socratesand Plato in taking the virtues to be central to a well-lived life.Like Plato, he regards the ethical virtues (justice, courage,temperance and so on) as complex rational, emotional and socialskills. But he rejects Plato's idea that to be completelyvirtuous one must acquire, through a training in the sciences,mathematics, and philosophy, an understanding of what goodness is.What we need, in order to live well, is a proper appreciation of theway in which such goods as friendship, pleasure, virtue, honor andwealth fit together as a whole. In order to apply that generalunderstanding to particular cases, we must acquire, through properupbringing and habits, the ability to see, on each occasion, whichcourse of action is best supported by reasons. Therefore practicalwisdom, as he conceives it, cannot be acquired solely by learninggeneral rules. We must also acquire, through practice, thosedeliberative, emotional, and social skills that enable us to put ourgeneral understanding of well-being into practice in ways that aresuitable to each occasion.},

The authors describe findings from a pan-Canadian Teacher Induction Survey (n=1,343) that examined perceptions and experiences of ECTs within K--12 publicly funded schools, with particular interest in retention, career interests and the impact of mentoring on well-being.An online survey was used to examine perceptions and experiences of ECTs within publicly funded K--12 schools across Canada. For this paper, the authors selectively analyzed 35 survey questions that pertained to mentorship and well-being of ECTs, using quantitative and qualitative procedures.The findings revealed a strong correlation between the mentoring experiences and well-being of the participating Canadian ECTs. The teachers who did not receive mentorship indicated significantly lower feelings of well-being, and conversely, teachers who participated in some kind of mentorship demonstrated much higher levels of well-being.This paper draws on the selective analysis of the data from a larger study to elicit the connections between the mentoring support and perceived well-being. Due to inconsistencies in terminology and multifaceted offerings of induction and mentoring supports for ECTs across Canada, there might have been some ambiguity regarding the formal and informal mentorship supports. A longitudinal study that is designed to specifically examine the connection between the mentorship and well-being of ECTs could yield deeper understandings. A comparative study in different international contexts is commended.The findings showed that the ECTs who did not receive any mentorship scored significantly lower feelings of well-being from external, structural, and internal well-being sources, and conversely, the ECTs who participated in some kind of mentorship scored much higher levels of feelings of well-being. Policy-makers should therefore continue to confidently include mentorship as an intentional strategy to support and help ECTs to flourish. However, inconsistent scoring between individuals and their levels of external, structural and internal well-being suggest that more research on the connection between mentoring and well-being of the ECTs.Work-life imbalance seems to be more challenging for ECTs than policymakers who provide these expectations are aware. Therefore, excessive work demands and intensive workloads need to be given proper attention for their potential negative effects (such as stress, burnout and absence) on the beginning teachers' health and well-being. Likewise, purposeful strength-based approaches should be undertaken to establish generative and pro-social efforts to enhance the connectedness, collaboration, collegiality and resilience-building opportunities for novice professionals within flourishing learning communities.In this paper, the authors have undertaken the first steps in exploring the impact that mentoring has on Canadian ECTs' well-being. The study increases the understanding of how mentoring can be used as a purposeful strategy to support the well-being of ECTs and retain them in the teaching profession in Canada and potentially in different international contexts.},

The research findings indicate that innovation positively impacts sustainability performance. The strongest and most favorable correlations occurred between economic innovation and sustainability performance and between environmental innovation and sustainability performance. Thus, the main contributions of the study are associated with: a) the existence of a positive and strong relationship between innovation and sustainability performance; b) evidence of innovation effect size on sustainability performance (combined effect size coefficient at r~=~0.529 (p-value {$<$}0.000)); c) an identification of the gaps in the scientific literature evaluating the effect of innovation on the sustainability of organizations; and d) the fail-safe Rosenthal value is 37,800, which indicates that the number of unpublished documents required to make the observed effect size insignificant is too large. Future studies can advance with meta analyzes that adopt moderating and mediating constructions to assess the relationship between innovation and performance in sustainability.},

  abstract = {Abstract                                           Maintaining students' privacy in higher education, an integral aspect of learning design and technology integration, is not only a matter of policy and law but also a matter of design ethics. Similar to faculty educators, learning designers in higher education play a vital role in maintaining students' privacy by designing learning experiences that rely on online technology integration. Like other professional designers, they need to care for the humans they design for by not producing designs that infringe on their privacy, thus, not causing harm. Recognizing that widely used instructional design models are silent on the topic and do not address ethical considerations such as privacy, we focus this paper on how design ethics can be leveraged by learning designers in higher education in a practical manner, illustrated through authentic examples. We highlight where the ethical responsibility of learning designers comes into the foreground when maintaining students' privacy and well-being, especially in online settings. We outline an existing ethical decision-making framework and show how learning designers can use it as a call to action to protect the students they design for, strengthening their ethical design capacity.                                                                                                                 Practitioner notes                                                           What is already known about this topic                                                                     Existing codes of ethical standards from well-known learning design organizations call upon learning designers to protect students' privacy without clear guidance on how to do so.                                                                       Design ethics within learning design is often discussed in abstract ways with principles that are difficult to apply.                                                                       Most, if not all, design models that learning design professionals have learned are either silent on design ethics and/or do not consider ethics as a valid dimension, thus, making design ethics mostly excluded from learning design graduate programs.                                                                       Practical means for engaging in ethical design practice are scarce in the field.

A demonstration of how to use a practical ethical decision-making framework as a designerly tool in designing for learning to maintain and protect students' privacy and well-being.                                                                       Authentic examples---in the form of vignettes---of ethical dilemmas/issues that learning designers in higher education could face, focused on students' privacy.                                                                       Methods---using a practical ethical decision-making framework---for learning design professionals in higher education, grounded in the philosophy of designers as the guarantors of designs, to be employed to detect situations where students' privacy and best interests are at risk.                                                                       A demonstration of how learning designers could make stellar design decisions in service to the students they design for and not to the priorities of other design stakeholders.                                                                                                       Implications for practice and/or policy                                                                     Higher education programs/institutions that prepare/employ learning designers ought to treat the topics of the designer's responsibility and design ethics more explicitly and practically as one of the means to maintain and protect students' privacy, in addition to law and policies.                                                                       Learning designers in higher education ought to hold a powerful position in their professional practice to maintain and protect students' privacy and well-being, as an important aspect of their ethical design responsibilities.                                                                       Learning designers in higher education ought to adopt a design thinking mindset in order to protect students' privacy by (1) challenging ideas and assumptions regarding technology integration in general and (2) detecting what is known in User Experience (UX) design as ``dark patterns'' in online course design.},

  abstract = {Emotion-focused family therapy (EFFT) is an innovative transdiagnostic approach to the treatment of mental health issues across the lifespan that involves caregivers for their healing power. EFFT can be used to treat many behavior or emotion-based disorders. The goal of EFFT is to support parents, partners, and other carers to increase their role in promoting the health and wellness of their loved ones. One of the key strengths of the EFFT approach is that EFFT clinicians can guide caregivers to provide home-based support, even when their loved one refuses or is unable to access service. This book serves as a clinical manual for the delivery of EFFT in the treatment of behavioral and mental health issues. It is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to the model for those who are new to EFFT and a deepened understanding of its theory and application for those already familiar with the stance and its interventions. The book provides an in-depth description of its application in the context of eating disorders as an example of the therapeutic process that clinicians can apply to other disorders. Clinicians and students in the fields of psychology, social work, psychotherapy, and family counseling, including divinity counseling, will find the book useful whether they adopt EFFT as a primary approach or as an adjunct to other approaches. The five modules in EFFT include emotion coaching; behavior coaching; therapeutic apologies; caregiver blocks; and clinician blocks. The book is structured into eight chapters covering the above topics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Numerous spirituality models and tools have been developed in health education and research, but a gap still exists around the conceptual clarity and articulation of spirituality among nurses and healthcare providers. Nurses and healthcare providers still find it difficult to interpret and apply the concepts of spirituality in their practice settings. This paper provides a concept analysis of spirituality using the Walker and Avant method of conceptual analysis. Several databases including conceptual and empirical literature from various disciplines have been used. The defining attributes of spirituality included spirituality and religion as a separable or mutual construct, spirituality as a personal construct, wholeness and integration, meaning making and purpose, sense of connectedness and relationship, transcendence, inner source of power, energy, and strength. Major antecedents of spirituality found were faith, personal values, and belief systems, and life adversities. Consequences of spirituality included personal/spiritual growth and wellbeing, resilience, and religiousness. Spirituality is a unique and personal human experience, an individualised journey characterised by multiple experiential accounts such as meaning making, purpose, connectedness, wholeness and integration, energy, and transcendence. Spiritual experiences are often difficult to examine and measure using scientific tools and empirical language. Healthcare providers need to fully understand and apply spirituality and spiritual care aspects to provide holistic person-centred care.},

The text is driven by a single key question: "What are the ways of thinking, seeing, and knowing that characterize Women's and Gender Studies and are valued by its practitioners?" Rather than taking a topical approach, Threshold Concepts develops the key concepts and ways of thinking that students need in order to develop a deep understanding and to approach material like feminist scholars do, across disciplines. This book illustrates four of the most critical concepts in Women's and Gender Studies{\texthorizontalbar}the social construction of gender, privilege and oppression, intersectionality, and feminist praxis{\texthorizontalbar}and grounds these concepts in multiple illustrations.The second edition includes a significant number of updates, revisions, and expansions: the case studies in all five chapters have been revised and expanded, as have the end of chapter elements, statistics have been updated, and numerous references to significant news stories and cultural developments of the past three years have been added. Finally, many more "callbacks" to previous chapters have been incorporated throughout the textbook in order to remind students to carry forward and build upon what they have learned about each threshold concept even as they move on to a new one.},

One hundred eight college students (44 males and 64 females) participated in two interviews about times of interpersonal betrayal, one about a parent and one about a friend/partner. Measures of forgiving personality and state forgiveness were collected, as well as stress, hostility, empathy, and self-reported illness symptoms. During baseline, interviews and recovery periods, repeated measures were taken of blood pressure, heart rate, frontalis EMG, and skin conductance. Trait forgiveness was associated with lower levels of blood pressure. State forgiveness was associated with lower blood pressure levels, heart rate, and rate pressure product. Acute, stress-induced reactivity was also linked to forgiveness: state forgiveness was associated with diastolic and mean arterial pressure and rate pressure product reactivity during the parent interview. Increased blood pressure recovery after stress was also linked to trait forgiveness. Forgiveness may produce beneficial effects directly by reducing allostatic load associated with betrayal and conflict, and indirectly through reductions in perceived stress.},

  abstract = {Objectives:Recovery is a multifaceted concept, and the need for operationalization in practice has been identified. Although guidance on recovery-oriented practice exists, it is from disparate sources and is difficult to apply. The aims of the study were to identify the key characteristics of recovery-oriented practice guidance on the basis of current international perspectives and to develop an overarching conceptual framework to aid the translation of recovery guidance into practice.Methods:A qualitative analysis of 30 international documents offering recovery-oriented practice guidance was conducted. Inductive, semantic-level, thematic analysis was used to identify dominant themes. Interpretive analysis was then undertaken to group the themes into practice domains.Results:The guidance documents were diverse; from six countries---the United States, England, Scotland, Republic of Ireland, Denmark, and New Zealand---and varied in document type, categories of guidance, and level of service user involvement in guidance development. The emerging conceptual framework consists of 16 dominant themes, grouped into four practice domains: promoting citizenship, organizational commitment, supporting personally defined recovery, and working relationship.Conclusions:A key challenge for mental health services is the lack of clarity about what constitutes recovery-oriented practice. The conceptual framework contributes to this knowledge gap and provides a synthesis of recovery-oriented practice guidance. (Psychiatric Services 62:1470--1476, 2011)},

In this book, Lencioni brings together his vast experience and many of the themes cultivated in his other best-selling books and delivers a first: a cohesive and comprehensive exploration of the unique advantage organizational health provides.Simply put, an organization is healthy when it is whole, consistent and complete, when its management, operations and culture are unified. Healthy organizations outperform their counterparts, are free of politics and confusion and provide an environment where star performers never want to leave. Lencioni's first non-fiction book provides leaders with a groundbreaking, approachable model for achieving organizational health--complete with stories, tips and anecdotes from his experiences consulting to some of the nation's leading organizations. In this age of informational ubiquity and nano-second change, it is no longer enough to build a competitive advantage based on intelligence alone. The Advantage provides a foundational construct for conducting business in a new way--one that maximizes human potential and aligns the organization around a common set of principles"--},

  address = {San Francisco},
  abstract = {CLOSING THE EXECUTION GAP Once upon a time strategy was king. Leaders immersed themselves in the matter of planning how best to achieve their company's goals. The subject dominated the attention of senior executives and the writings of consultants and management gurus. Experts of various stripes weighed in on how to put strategic planning processes in place and transform employees at all levels into strategic thinkers. Naturally, leaders assumed all this strategizing would pay off. And yet, for too many organizations the promised results never came to pass. Quite simply, they couldn't execute. Now, the business world has shifted its focus to the consistent delivery of results. If an organization can't execute its plans and initiatives, nothing else matters: not the most solid, well thought-out strategy, not the most innovative business model, not even technological breakthroughs that could transform an industry. As it turns out, the'conventional wisdom'about what it takes to implement strategy and deliver results isn't all that wise. So what really differentiates the companies that are able to get things done day-to-day and deliver consistent results? The answer is found in the pages of Richard Lepsinger's ground-breaking book, Closing the Execution Gap. Based on extensive research and years of practical experience, the book outlines five prerequisites for effective execution and five'Bridges'that differentiate companies that do it best. It also describes six'Bridge Builders'leaders at all levels can use to close the execution gap in their company or team and help people get things done. Specifically, it addresses: What really gets in the way of getting things donefor individuals, teams and entire companies What leaders can do to enhance their organization's ability to close the execution gap and achieve solid business results What it takes to consistently execute plans and initiatives at a day-to-day operational level The book features many case studies of companies that have a track record of effective execution (Hewlett-Packard, Costco, Procter \&amp; Gamble) and those who have struggled with closing the gap between creating a vision and delivering results (Dell, American Airlines, GM). As the business world becomes more competitive and less forgiving, execution matters more than ever. This is a book for the times we live inand one that for many companies could mean the difference between success and failure.},

By the end of this brief presentation on SOAP Note examples you will take away these three things:  Understand the SOAP acronym  View a practical example  See how a quality SOAP note does half the work for you Before we begin you should know that forms do not have be a necessary evil. Quality forms serve as a guide that effortlessly leads you and your clients through the therapeutic process. You'll see exactly what I mean as we go through a SOAP Note example in just a few moments. But first a reminder of what SOAP stands for  S. Subjective: this is referring to what client tells you: This would include symptoms, current stressors, and motivation level: what they are most interested in resolving or working on. Use words like ``client reported{\dots}'' The S, O, A and P should flow from one element of the note format to the next to create a meaningful conclusion in the assessment and plan. O. Objective data has to do with what the counselor observed about the client in the session. It should be documented in a measurable and observable way. The therapist may use words like ``observed'' in writing this section of the note{\dots}but keep in mind this is not your opinion -- think measurable and observable. A. Assessment -- this is the core of the note -- this is where you as a clinician take what your client shares (the subjective data) and assimilate it with what you as a professional therapist observed and try to make sense out of it for the purpose of helping your client. P. Plan - is the action step both the counselor and the client are committing to. Plan can also include recommendations and referral information. Here is a take away tip -- Schedule time after each session to at least begin your SOAP. it should take about 5 minutes to write your SOAP. One of the problems we counselors run into when writing our soap notes is not making the time to complete them soon after the session. Commit to finishing your notes by the end of each working day. Summary -- SOAP stands for S= Subjective -- this is your clients report, O stands for objective, this is largely the therapists measurable and observable observations, A stands for assessment, this is where you the therapist assimilate the S and O and finally the P or Plan which is the action steps you and your client will take.

A review of randomised trials that compared PPI to other active interventions was conducted. A systematic search was undertaken using PsycInfo, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, two trial registries, and a manual search. The outcomes were happiness and depression. Ten studies, totalling 1341 participants, were included in the review. The small effect sizes for depression (Hedge's g\,=\,0.15) and happiness (Hedge's g\,=\,0.20) favoured PPI but were not significant, indicating no difference between PPI and other active interventions for the outcomes. Heterogeneity was high mainly due to differences in trial implementation. Risks of bias ranged from moderate to high. The results should be interpreted with caution because of the small number of included studies, high heterogeneity, and presence of bias.},

Research is needed to understand procrastination and delay patterns of students in online self-paced courses to predict successful completion and retention. This article examines three measures of delay in undergraduate online self-paced courses: the days between registration date and first date of assignment submission (Days to Start), the average days between assignment submissions (Days between Assignments), and total days between registration and completion (Days to Complete). The average length of time between assignment submissions was found to be most useful to predict final letter grade and withdrawal. Students' consistency and regular work on a self-paced class may be the best strategy for success. Institutions offering self-paced courses should implement strategies to teach students self-regulating behaviors.},

  abstract = {Leadership, due to its power to influence, is one of the most important tools available to organisation in order to become competitive, and as such it is one of the recurring themes in social sciences. Today, new leadership strategies have emerged as new drivers of effectiveness in workplace relationships based on the leader-follower relationship. One of these leadership strategies is servant leadership, whose motto is 'put and promote followers' interests and needs first', which makes this leadership style strongly linked to exercising high ethics. As agapao love and service to others are important distinctive features of these leaders' decisions and behaviours, the ethical influence relationship with their collaborators is thought to reach high levels. It is no surprise then that this ethical influence relationship makes followers to serve others and inculcates in followers values such as acceptance, tolerance, empathy, love, or forgiveness. More importantly, these leaders might make followers to grow in matureness, intelligence, creativity, and self-management, among other aspects. However, despite findings in recent literature of positive effects of servant leadership on valuable employee outcomes, research is still lacking on the results of this phenomenon on collective organisational variables and its influence in work groups. A case study analysis of a historic and emblematic hotel situated in a small Spanish city declared by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site provides evidence of the relationship between servant leadership and valuable work-group outcomes such as empowerment climate and group creativity.},

  abstract = {Introduction: This review provides a national summary of what is currently known about the Canadian opioid crisis with respect to opioid-related deaths and harms and potential risk factors as of December 2017. Methods: We reviewed all public-facing opioid-related surveillance or epidemiological reports published by provincial and territorial ministries of health and chief coroners' or medical examiners' offices. In addition, we reviewed publications from federal partners and reports and articles published prior to December 2017. We synthesized the evidence by comparing provincial and territorial opioid-related mortality and morbidity rates with the national rates to look for regional trends. Results: The opioid crisis has affected every region of the country, although some jurisdictions have been impacted more than others. As of 2016, apparent opioid-related deaths and hospitalization rates were highest in the western provinces of British Columbia and Alberta and in both Yukon and the Northwest Territories. Nationally, most apparent opioid-related deaths occurred among males; individuals between 30 and 39 years of age accounted for the greatest proportion. Current evidence suggests regional age and sex differences with respect to health outcomes, especially when synthetic opioids are involved. However, differences between data collection methods and reporting requirements may impact the interpretation and comparability of reported data. Conclusion: This report identifies gaps in evidence and areas for further investigation to improve our understanding of the national opioid crisis. The Public Health Agency of Canada will continue to work closely with the provinces, territories and national partners to further refine and standardize national data collection, conduct special studies and expand information-sharing to improve the evidence needed to inform public health action and prevent opioid-related deaths and harms.},

While there have been reviews on a particular online assessment approach (e.g., online examinations or tests), there has not been a knowledge synthesis that considers online assessment research as a whole. A holistic understanding of online assessment research is important, as it recognizes differences in assessment approaches and the role of technologies in assessment. This understanding helps researchers navigate the heterogeneous body of research and allows educators to make research-informed improvements. To establish such an understanding, we analyzed 235 articles, following a mapping review and a narrative synthesis method. The findings revealed tests, assignments and skills assessments are major online assessment approaches. While research into tests reported using online technologies mainly to substitute or augment existing assessment, research into assignments and skills assessments was more likely to report using online technologies to modify or redefine assessment. Further, we identified disparities across the three approaches regarding academic misconduct, assessment validity, and reliability. We also identified a dearth of comparative research and a reliance on overall satisfaction and short-term self-reported impact measures as indicators of success. We discuss the implications of this review to provide insights for institutions and educators seeking to improve online assessment practices.},

Little relationship between religious commitment and ethical judgment was found when responses were compared on the basis of broad faith categories -- Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, other religions, and no religion. However, respondents who indicated that religious interests were of high or moderate importance to them demonstrated a higher level of ethical judgment (less accepting of unethical decisions) than others in their evaluations.

  abstract = {Nerve cells (i.e., neurons) communicate via a combination of electrical and chemical signals. Within the neuron, electrical signals driven by charged particles allow rapid conduction from one end of the cell to the other. Communication between neurons occurs at tiny gaps called synapses, where specialized parts of the two cells (i.e., the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons) come within nanometers of one another to allow for chemical transmission. The presynaptic neuron releases a chemical (i.e., a neurotransmitter) that is received by the postsynaptic neuron's specialized proteins called neurotransmitter receptors. The neurotransmitter molecules bind to the receptor proteins and alter postsynaptic neuronal function. Two types of neurotransmitter receptors exist---ligand-gated ion channels, which permit rapid ion flow directly across the outer cell membrane, and G-protein--coupled receptors, which set into motion chemical signaling events within the cell. Hundreds of molecules are known to act as neurotransmitters in the brain. Neuronal development and function also are affected by peptides known as neurotrophins and by steroid hormones. This article reviews the chemical nature, neuronal actions, receptor subtypes, and therapeutic roles of several transmitters, neurotrophins, and hormones. It focuses on neurotransmitters with important roles in acute and chronic alcohol effects on the brain, such as those that contribute to intoxication, tolerance, dependence, and neurotoxicity, as well as maintained alcohol drinking and addiction.},

Self-determination theory espouses the centrality of autonomy, competence, and relatedness to human motivation. Servant leadership emphasizes serving and caring for others. Ethical leaders consistently make morally reasoned decisions. Emotionally intelligent leaders are self-aware and self-regulating, nurture motivation, and stress empathy and social skill. An analysis of the literature revealed 10 shared characteristics connecting the three components of self-determination theory, including awareness, empathy, fairness, integrity, moral values, motivation, trust, relationship management, respect, and self-management. Synergies among ethical leadership, servant leadership, and emotional intelligence to leadership in a variety of settings emerged. Effective leaders use awareness, empathy, fairness, integrity, moral values, motivation, trust, relationship management, respect, and self-management contributing to needs satisfaction in followers' autonomy, competence, and relatedness. In conclusion, leadership effectiveness can increase when leaders demonstrate integrity, trust, and respect, serve others with empathy and fairness, and are personally and socially competent.

This black-and-white vision of happiness works to discourage us from recognizing the upside of any negative and limits our potential for personal growth. A corrective course on happiness and a call to regard life's twists and turns with a more open mind, The Myths of Happiness shares practical lessons that prove we are more adaptable than we think we are. It empowers readers to look beyond their first response, sharing scientific evidence that often it is our mindset---not our circumstances---that matters most.},

While the prevailing leadership literature has for the most part focussed on the relationship between leaders and followers in the organization and defined followers as subordinates, we show in this article that leadership takes place in interaction with a multitude of followers as stakeholders inside and outside the corporation. Using an ethical lens, we discuss leadership responsibilities in a stakeholder society, thereby following Bass and Steidelmeier's suggestion to discuss ``leadership in the context of contemporary stakeholder theory'' (1999: 200). Moreover, from a relational and stakeholder perspective we approach the questions: What is responsible leadership? What makes a responsible leader? What qualities are needed? Finally, we propose a so-called ``roles model'' of responsible leadership, which gives a gestalt to a responsible leader and describes the different roles he or she takes in leading stakeholders and business in society.},

Results indicate that administrators did not receive extensive training and, of the training they did receive, most did not find it very useful. Most administrators did not feel strongly that the classroom observations adequately assessed teacher practice and most did not feel that there had been substantial improvement in teacher practice in their schools as a result of the process. The most common suggestions for improvement were to have more classroom observations, some of which are unannounced; to evaluate teachers more frequently; and to have more than two rating categories.},

Asynchronous means that there is no set time for the learning to be occurring. Learners can learn anywhere and can consume their time to gain knowledge of what they want to know and when they need to know. Synchronous e-learning is related to structure and time bounded activities, which are offered through web conferencing and chatting options. E-learning resources give option to do one, or both. Population of the study comprised all the students of two public universities situated in Lahore. Subjects of the study comprised purposively selected 128 Male and 158 Female students. Data were collected only from those students who were having experience of synchronous along with asynchronous e-learning activities. A self-developed instrument was used to collect data. To validate the instrument a pilot study was done, which showed statistically significant reliability index (Cronbach Alpha) = .83. SPSS was used for data analysis. Independent sample t-test was used to find out difference in male and female students' opinions. Descriptive statistics were used to present students' responses related to different aspects of e-learning. Findings revealed statistically significant difference in students' responses regarding effectiveness of synchronous and asynchronous e-learning activities. Male students preferred synchronous as well as asynchronous e-learning activities more than female students at higher education level. Students' were found to have greater interest in synchronous activities when they had credit in terms of marks.},

  abstract = {The existing literature lacks a precise understanding of how online facilitation and dialogic discussions can positively impact students' comprehension of the Nature of Science (NoS). This study delves into the experiences of students and facilitators engaged in synchronous and asynchronous online dialogic discussions and e-facilitation to enhance our understanding of NoS. An innovative experiment employed a digital dialogue game to engage postgraduate students in a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) secondary science course. The participants included sixty-five PGCE science students and three lecturers specializing in different science disciplines (Physics, Chemistry, and Biology). Qualitative data collection methods and analysis, including transcripts of online discussions about NoS topics, were followed by critical event recall interviews to identify specific online dialogue events that significantly contributed to the comprehension of NoS.~The findings contribute significantly to comprehending students' processes in grasping complex and debatable topics such as Nature of Science (NoS) within online dialogic discussions supported by e-facilitation. They emphasize the importance of establishing an open and expansive dialogic space, with a focus on the crucial roles of e-facilitators. The results also highlight a tension between active and passive roles in both synchronous and asynchronous online discussions. Additionally, the study sheds light on the influence of space, time, and texts in understanding NoS through e-facilitated online dialogic discussions. Notably, the research emphasizes the live chat room's significance within Interloc, accentuating its role as a social space fostering a sense of community and a safe environment for inquiry in online dialogue which supported understanding NoS.},

An expanded "self-leadership" view is developed that includes (a) self-imposed strategies for managing performance of tasks of low intrinsic motivational potential and (b) self-influence that capitalizes on the "natural"/intrinsic motivational value of task activity. Implications for theory and practice are addressed.},

Health Systems in Transition: Canada provides an insightful and objective analysis of the organization, governance, financing, and delivery of health care as well as comparisons between the Canadian system and others internationally. This book draws on a wide range of empirical studies and statistical data within Canada and across comparable countries to provide a thorough description of the many facets of health care in Canada. Drawing on the most reliable and recent data available, this study reveals the strengths and weakness of Canadian health care. This assessment is based on numerous comparisons of Canada to peer countries (Australia, France, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and among provinces and territories within Canada. It will be of interest to scholars and students in Canada wanting to learn more about the largest and most celebrated public program, and for those outside Canada interested in comparative systems and policy research.},

It's hard because it forces people and organizations to make specific choices about their future---something that doesn't happen in most companies.Now two of today's best-known business thinkers get to the heart of strategy---explaining what it's for, how to think about it, why you need it, and how to get it done. And they use one of the most successful corporate turnarounds of the past century, which they achieved together, to prove their point.A.G. Lafley, former CEO of Procter \&amp; Gamble, in close partnership with strategic adviser Roger Martin, doubled P\&amp;G's sales, quadrupled its profits, and increased its market value by more than \$100 billion in just ten years. Now, drawn from their years of experience at P\&amp;G and the Rotman School of Management, where Martin is dean, this book shows how leaders in organizations of all sizes can guide everyday actions with larger strategic goals built around the clear, essential elements that determine business success---where to play and how to win.The result is a playbook for winning. Lafley and Martin have created a set of five essential strategic choices that, when addressed in an integrated way, will move you ahead of your competitors. They are:{$\bullet$} What is our winning aspiration?{$\bullet$} Where will we play?{$\bullet$} How will we win?{$\bullet$} What capabilities must we have in place to win?{$\bullet$} What management systems are required to support our choices?The stories of how P\&amp;G repeatedly won by applying this method to iconic brands such as Olay, Bounty, Gillette, Swiffer, and Febreze clearly illustrate how deciding on a strategic approach---and then making the right choices to support it---makes the difference between just playing the game and actually winning.},

  abstract = {It has been said that the Canadian health care system is a system of pilot projects: islands of excellence in a sea of challenges. In recent years, much work has been done to try to highlight and disseminate successful projects to improve quality, access and equity - and much remains to be done to ensure that we are not all continually trying to reinvent the wheel. But in the area of learning from each other's failures, we are even further behind. In the policy world, the clinical world and the research world, sharing failures is discouraged - let alone celebrating them. Dr. Danielle Martin will discuss why the health care system needs to learn to scale up both our successes and our failures, and how we might begin to do so.  BIO: Danielle Martin is Vice-President, Medical Affairs and Health System Solutions at Women's College Hospital (WCH). She is a family physician in the Family Practice Health Centre at WCH and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the University of Toronto. Danielle's focus is on improving health at the system level as well as the individual level. Her clinical work has involved remote northern medicine as well as a current focus on maternity care, and she will complete a Masters of Public Policy at the School of Public Policy and Governance, University of Toronto in April 2013. Danielle's policy expertise and passion for equity have made her an emerging leader in the debate over the future of Canada's health-care system. A recipient of the Canadian Medical Association Award for Young Leaders, she sat two terms on the Health Council of Canada from 2005-2011. In 2006 the Ontario College of Family Physicians recognized her as one of three New Family Doctors of the Year. Danielle was a leader throughout her medical training and served both as President of the Canadian Federation of Medical Students (CFMS) and President of the Professional Association of Interns and Residents of Ontario (PAIRO). In 2006, her first year in practice, she helped launch Canadian Doctors for Medicare, the voice for Canadian physicians who believe in "a high quality, equitable, sustainable health system built on the best available evidence as the highest expression of Canadians caring for one another". She chaired the board of CDM until May 2013. Danielle serves on a number of boards and was recently named by the Toronto Star in its list of the "13 People to Watch in 2013." In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)}

The framework's strong grounding in research and theory makes it a natural partner for performance assessment. Assessment is seen as closely linked to teaching and learning, and it should therefore be conducted in a way that provides useful feedback to teachers, students, and parents. The second part of this book provides tools for performance assessment based on the Dimensions of Learning  model. Examples of performance tasks are given, and rubrics are provided for specific tasks and situations. As defined for this work, rubrics consist of descriptions of four levels of performance for a given standard. Summary rubrics and rubrics for students to apply to tasks are also included. (SLD)},

  abstract = {Canadian physician Gabor Mat{\'e} is a specialist in terminal illnesses, chemical dependents, and HIV positive patients. Dr. Mat{\'e} is a renowned author of books and columnist known for his knowledge about attention deficit disorder, stress, chronic illness and parental relations. His theme at TEDxRio+20 was addiction -- from drugs to power. From the lack of love to the desire to escape oneself, from susceptibility of the being to interior power -- nothing escapes. And he risks a generic and generous prescription: "Find your nature and be nice to yourself." In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)}

  address = {Berkeley, Calif},
  abstract = {A ``thought-provoking and powerful'' study that reframes everything you've been taught about addiction and recovery---from the New York Times--bestselling author of The Myth of Normal (Bruce Perry, author of The Boy Who Was Raised as a Dog). A world-renowned trauma expert combines real-life stories with cutting-edge research to offer a holistic approach to understanding addiction---its origins, its place in society, and the importance of self-compassion in recovery. Based on Gabor Mat{\'e}'s two decades of experience as a medical doctor and his groundbreaking work with people with addiction on Vancouver's skid row, this \#1 international bestseller radically re-envisions a much misunderstood condition by taking a compassionate approach to substance abuse and addiction recovery. ~ In the same vein as Bessel van der Kolk's The Body Keeps the Score, In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts traces the root causes of addiction to childhood trauma and examines the pervasiveness of addiction in society. Dr. Mat{\'e} presents addiction not as a discrete phenomenon confined to an unfortunate or weak-willed few, but as a continuum that runs throughout---and perhaps underpins---our society. It is not a medical ``condition'' distinct from the lives it affects but rather the result of a complex interplay among personal history, emotional and neurological development, brain chemistry, and the drugs and behaviors of addiction.Simplifying a wide array of brain and addiction research findings from around the globe, the book avoids glib self-help remedies, instead promoting a thorough and compassionate self-understanding as the first key to healing and wellness.Dr. Mat{\'e}~argues persuasively against contemporary health, social, and criminal justice policies toward addiction and how they perpetuate the War on Drugs. The mix of personal stories---including the author's candid discussion of his own ``high-status'' addictive tendencies---and science with positive solutions makes the book equally useful for lay readers and professionals.},

This collection features forty-four renowned servant leadership experts and practitioners---prominent business executives, bestselling authors, and respected spiritual leaders---who offer advice and tools for implementing this proven, but for some still radical, leadership model.Edited by legendary business author and lifelong servant leader Ken Blanchard and his longtime editor Renee Broadwell, this is the most comprehensive and wide-ranging guide ever published for what is, in every sense, a better way to lead.``Renowned expert Ken Blanchard with Renee Broadwell have assembled the insights of dozens of successful leaders in their new book Servant Leadership In Action. I doubt you will find any book or course on leadership that delivers a more on-target message of the essential element critical to being a truly great leader. Get a copy. Read it. Be it.'' ---Miami Herald``A comprehensive and inspiring book presented as a servant leadership primer, action plan and how-to guide, then concludes with proof of effectiveness and inspiration to go forward. The wide-ranging yet related topics covered in Servant Leadership In Action is part of what makes the book so valuable.

  abstract = {For human beings, the self is what happens when ``I'' encounters ``Me.'' The central psychological question of selfhood, then, is this: How does a person apprehend and understand who he or she is?  Over the past 100 years, psychologists have approached the study of self (and the related concept of identity) in many different ways, but three central metaphors for the self repeatedly emerge. First, the self may be seen as a social actor, who enacts roles and displays traits by performing behaviors in the presence of others. Second, the self is a motivated agent, who acts upon inner desires and formulates goals, values, and plans to guide behavior in the future. Third, the self eventually becomes an autobiographical author, too, who takes stock of life \&mdash;\&nbsp;past, present, and future \&mdash;\&nbsp;to create a story about who I am, how I came to be, and where my life may be going. This module briefly reviews central ideas and research findings on the self as an actor, an agent, and an author, with an emphasis on how these features of selfhood develop over the human life course.},

The authors begin with a description of unifying themes in postcolonial theory, with an emphasis on colonized subjectivities and imperialism; the application of a critical social science perspective, including postcolonial feminist theory; and the project of working toward decolonization. Processes involved in the colonization of nursing are described in detail, including colonization of nursing's intellectual development and the white privilege and racism that sustain colonizing thinking and action in nursing. The authors conclude with strategies to increase the counter-narrative to continued colonization, with a focus on critical social justice, human rights and the structural determinants of health.},

  abstract = {Purpose-a cognitive process that defines life goals and provides personal meaning{\texthorizontalbar}may help explain disparate empirical social science findings. Devoting effort and making progress toward life goals provides a significant, renewable source of engagement and meaning. Purpose offers a testable, causal system that synthesizes outcomes including life expectancy, satisfaction, and mental and physical health. These outcomes may be explained best by considering the motivation of the individual-a motivation that comes from having a purpose. We provide a detailed definition with specific hypotheses derived from a synthesis of relevant findings from social, behavioral, biological, and cognitive literatures. To illustrate the uniqueness of the purpose model, we compared purpose with competing contemporary models that offer similar predictions. Addressing the structural features unique to purpose opens opportunities to build upon existing causal models of how and why health and well-being develop and change over time.},

  abstract = {Flexible delivery of educational resources must take account of cultural variables and recognise the specific learning needs, preferences and styles of learners. In designing instruction, there may be a tension between the need to ensure access for a diverse student population, while at the same time taking into account the need for localisation to accommodate learners' particular cultures, cognitive styles and preferences. Considering the micro and macro cultural levels of instructional design is therefore essential if appropriate learning environments are to be created. The acceptance, use and impact of WWW sites is affected by the cultural backgrounds, values, needs and preferences of learners.One of the limitations in current instructional design models is that they do not fully contextualise the learning experience, and are themselves the product of particular cultures. The design of Web based instruction is not culturally neutral, but instead is based on the particular epistemologies, learning theories and goal orientations of the designers themselves. Recently, theorists have argued for a cultural dimension in the design process and the need to provide culturally sensitive learning environments.In this paper, we trace the design processes involved in the development of an online learning environment for indigenous Australian learners preparing to enter university, and account for the cultural issues that impacted on creation of learning tasks and styles of communication. The paper argues for cultural localisation, which means incorporating the local values, styles of learning and cognitive preferences of the target population. It also means going beyond surface level design considerations, to achieve culturally inclusive constructivist learning environments. Examples of tasks, activities and forms of online interaction are provided in the context of a bi-cultural model of learning that recognises diversity and different learning needs. It is recommended that when creating WWW based course support sites for cultural inclusivity, systematic attention must be given to particular design guidelines, which include responsiveness to learner needs, community based learning and cultural contextualisation of learning activities.},

"Developing Cultural Competence for Agencies" helps social service agencies develop and assess their level of cultural competence through examination of their goals; agency structure; staff, board, and agency attributes; etc. A literature  review explores the types of cultural competence models in use by agencies, including the outreach model, the mainstream agency support of services by minorities model, bilingual/bicultural services, and minority agencies providing services to members of minority communities. The Child and Adolescent Service System Program Minority Initiative, a program of the National Institute of Mental Health, is also described.

  abstract = {The field of positive psychology rests on the assumption that certain psychological traits and processes are inherently beneficial for well-being. We review evidence that challenges this assumption. First, we review data from 4 independent longitudinal studies of marriage revealing that 4 ostensibly positive processes---forgiveness, optimistic expectations, positive thoughts, and kindness---can either benefit or harm well-being depending on the context in which they operate. Although all 4 processes predicted better relationship well-being among spouses in healthy marriages, they predicted worse relationship well-being in more troubled marriages. Then, we review evidence from other research that reveals that whether ostensibly positive psychological traits and processes benefit or harm well-being depends on the context of various noninterpersonal domains as well. Finally, we conclude by arguing that any movement to promote well-being may be most successful to the extent that it (a) examines the conditions under which the same traits and processes may promote versus threaten well-being, (b) examines both healthy and unhealthy people, (c) examines well-being over substantial periods of time, and (d) avoids labeling psychological traits and processes as positive or negative.

How can we use this information to improve curriculum, instruction, and assessment so our students achieve deep learning and understanding in all subject areas? Upgrade Your Teaching: Understanding by Design Meets Neuroscience answers these questions by merging insights from neuroscience with Understanding by Design (UbD), the framework used by thousands of educators to craft units of instruction and authentic assessments that emphasize understanding rather than recall. Readers will learn - How the brain processes incoming information and determines what is (or is not) retained as long-term memory; - How brain science reveals factors that influence student motivation and willingness to put forth effort; - How to fully engage all students through relevance and achievable challenge; - How key components of UbD, including backward design, essential questions, and transfer tasks, are supported by research in neuroscience; - Why specific kinds of teaching and assessment strategies are effective in helping students gain the knowledge, skills, and deep understanding they need to succeed in school and beyond; and - How to create a brain-friendly classroom climate that supports lasting learning. Authors Jay McTighe and Judy Willis translate research findings into practical information for everyday use in schools, at all grade levels and in all subject areas. With their guidance, educators at all levels can learn how to design and implement units that empower teachers and students alike to capitalize on the brain's tremendous capacity for learning.},

HRQOL is a multidimensional construct that consists of at least three broad domains - physical, psychological, and social functioning - that are affected by one's disease and/or treatment. HRQoL is usually measured in chronic conditions and is frequently impaired to a great extent. In addition, factors that are associated with good and poor HRQoL, as well as HRQoL assessment will be discussed. The estimation of the relative impact of chronic diseases on HRQoL is necessary in order to better plan and distribute health care resources aiming at a better HRQoL.

The notion of AI comprises a wide-ranging set of technologies that allow individuals and organizations to integrate and analyze data and use that insight to improve or automate decision-making. While most attention has been placed on the positive aspects companies realize by the adoption by the adoption and use of AI, there is a growing concern around the negative and unintended consequences of such technologies. In this special issue we have made a call for research papers that help us explore the dark side of AI use. By adopting a dark side lens, we aimed to expand our understanding of how AI should be implemented in practice, and how to minimize or avoid negative outcomes. In this editorial, we build on the notion of responsible AI, to highlight the different ways in which AI can potentially produce unintended consequences, as well as to suggest alternative paths future IS research can follow to improve our knowledge about how to mitigate such occurrences. We further expand on dark side theorizing in order to uncover hidden assumptions of current literature as well as to propose other prominent themes that can guide future IS research on AI adoption and use.},

As such, post-secondary learners require critical competencies for strategically regulating learning with AI. While student beliefs about GenAI impact their interactions and decisions, research of students' perspectives is emergent. This study aimed to examine post-secondary students' perceptions about the effective use of GenAI for learning. Participants were 125 undergraduate students at a university in Canada. Results indicated students were confident in their ability to use GenAI for learning, perceived GenAI to be effective for learning, and reported using GenAI in a wide range of academic tasks, particularly when faced with cognition and time management challenges. Finally, access to information, personalized learning support, new learning approaches, and time were considered benefits of GenAI. However, students expressed concerns about academic integrity, information accuracy, and the impact on personal learning. Implications for scaffolding learners' development of skills for self-regulating interactions with AI critical for post-secondary and beyond are discussed.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

This revolutionary new book explains how removing stress from the classroom holds the key to improving education. The book also explains what administrators, teachers, parents, and communities can do to help accomplish a stress-free classroom.~For years, the expert voices said ``disengagement'' was the crucial issue behind poor educational environments and results. Naturally, only massive reform could fix it. But what if the enormous restructuring and expenditures attacked the wrong problem?~MindShift, an organization that reframes tired and clogged conversations, pushed the old conclusions off the table and started fresh. They gathered diverse leaders in education, leadership, neuroscience, architecture, and wellness in working forums around the nation. These pivotal meetings produced WHOLE, a game-changing approach to education. This book captures the story and details of how the system can be remade for real and lasting benefits to everyone.~With the authors' expertise, the book exposes the exhausted and antiquated thinking that led to the present crisis. But, WHOLE also proposes a new era of disruptive change that can produce happier, healthier, and more successful education for the 21st century. The book introduces the outliers, tells the stories, and presents the roadmaps to:Why teachers should be seen as high-performance athletes, requiring time for recovery and preparationHow schools can become ``field hospitals,'' combining learning with healingWhy space matters, how redesigning and refurnishing schools can eliminate stress and produce learning environments that are more open and invitingWays to properly integrate schools within communities, building honest relationships, increasing social capital, and achieving transparency that increases success~~Packed with real-life examples, new research, and solutions that you can introduce to your own schools, students, and communities, WHOLE shows us how to move schools from the age of stress and insecurity to an age of true educational flourishing.},

We develop several hypotheses by comparing the Apache project with several commercial projects. We then test and refine several of these hypotheses, based on an analysis of Mozilla data.

McMaster, author of Dereliction of Duty: Lyndon Johnson, Robert McNamara, The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Lies that Led to VietnamHal Moore led his life by a set of principles -- a code developed through years of experience, trial-and-error, and the study of leaders of every stripe. In a career spanning more than thirty years, Moore's life touched upon many historical events: the Occupation of Japan, the Korean War, Vietnam, and the refashioning of the US Army into an all-volunteer force. At each juncture, he learned critical lessons and had opportunities to affect change through measured responses.

She begins with a discussion of the cultural and linguistic reasons that Indigenous languages are so important. She then describes why they are at risk of being lost, with a focus on Canadian historical and current social contexts, from the genocide of residential schools to modern policy developments. Finally, she explores what practical things communities can do to help make sure that Indigenous language revitalization is a reality. She also describes what is needed in terms of policy, education, and support to ensure that Indigenous languages survive to be passed on to the next seven generations. After all, any reconciliation that does not involve the preservation and growth of Indigenous languages and cultures is no reconciliation at all: it is assimilation. Dr. Lindsay Morcom (Algonquin M{\'e}tis, Bear Clan) is an interdisciplinary researcher with experience in education, Aboriginal languages, language revitalization, and linguistics. She earned her Master's degree in Linguistics at First Nations University through the University of Regina in 2006. She then completed her doctorate in General Linguistics and Comparative Philology as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University in 2010. She now works as an assistant professor and coordinator of the Aboriginal Teacher Education Program at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada.

In three studies, we demonstrated that gratitude is prototypically organized; that there are cross-cultural differences between UK and US descriptions of gratitude; and that judgments of gratitude are closely related to judgments of virtue. Study 1 demonstrated that the frequencies of negative attributes are considerably greater in the UK than in the USA. We suggest that gratitude has a common core with culturally ubiquitous features, but also socially constructed elements specific to individual cultures. Study 2 noted discrepancies between centrality and frequency ratings. We propose that prototype analyses should consider both intuitive frequency ratings and the deliberative processes involved in assessing centrality. In Study 3, we noted a significant correlation between judgments of gratitude and judgments of virtue, suggesting the two are intrinsically linked.

  abstract = {Aims and objectives To elucidate the synergies between fundamental care and seminal nursing theories. Background Nursing theories are often criticised for their limited clinical relevance, with the existence of a theory-to-practice gap widely acknowledged. Pervasive examples of poor-quality care, particularly for people's most fundamental needs, raise questions as to whether nursing theories sufficiently prioritise fundamental care. The Fundamentals of Care Framework (hereinafter ``the Framework'') represents a valid, comprehensive and evidence-based description of fundamental care. The Framework captures the complexity and multidimensionality of fundamental care delivery, predicated on the nurse--patient relationship; integration of physical, psychosocial and relational needs; and a supportive context. Despite strong face validity, the Framework's alignment with seminal nursing theories remains unexplored. Design Narrative review. Method Twenty-nine seminal nursing theories were included. Categories for analysis were developed inductively and deductively, focusing on the themes of relationship, integration of care, context and the theories' ease of use. Results are reported in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Results Though relationship, integration of care and context and were features shared across a number of nursing theories, no single theory depicts these collectively to the same extent as the Framework. In particular, integration of physical, psychosocial and relational aspects of care was found to be poorly described in the theories. Conclusion Failure to account for integration of care means that nursing theories continue to conceptualise fundamental care as a series of discrete tasks. To ensure relevance at the point of care, future nursing theories must accurately reflect the complexities of fundamental care delivery, specifically the need to integrate multiple care needs simultaneously, alongside being straightforward to apply in practice. Relevance to clinical practice Bridging the theory-to-practice gap requires a nursing discourse that is relevant at the point of care. We provide suggestions for how future nursing theories can bridge this gap.},

Eight young learners and five EFL teachers took part in this qualitative study. In-depth semi-structured interviews were employed to collect qualitative data. The results depict that there are benefits and barriers of digital literacy for young learners in learning English. The benefits of digital literacy include improving young learners' writing, reading, listening, and speaking skills, getting used to authentic materials, increasing frequency of digital technology use, enhancing online collaboration between teacher-learners and learners-learners. However, this study reports that digital literacy also has some negative impact for young learners. Problems with weak signals which affect difficult internet access still remain a problem. Contents of online digital materials are not easy for young learners to interpret and convert into simple, self-regulated information. Moreover, digital literacy tools are considered to be expensive. These barriers might be influenced by other problems such as complexity of digital literacy tools, different comprehension levels among young learners, young learners and EFL teachers' lack of digital literacy experiences. In conclusion, the results give valuable insights in how to go about integration of digital literacy tools for young learners.},

As the health care industry becomes more complex, leadership and the examination of how to most effectively apply it to meet efficiency standards and optimize the patient experience will become paramount. Through this paper the authors provide the foundation for meeting this need through an innovative and socially adept framework that identifies the critical character attributes of a serving leader and the powerful impact that serving leaders can have on patient outcomes in the health care setting. This framework is grounded in a leadership theoretical foundation and contextually examined through qualitative methods. As the business of health care becomes more complex and more competitive, finding ways to improve processes and create healing environments conducive to improved patient outcomes will differentiate average health care and excellent health care in the future. This paper provides the impetus for successfully addressing these needs through the development of serving leaders, and three specific characteristics: emotional care, presence, and awareness.Keywords: servant leadership, health care, patient outcomes},

In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory--has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences. This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in the New York Times, tthe American Economic Review, and a variety of other publications. Together, these writings provide readers a matchless opportunity to more fully appreciate a work whose influence will yet resound for generations to come.},

TRANSCRIPT: Welcome to 2 minute neuroscience, where I simplistically explain neuroscience topics in 2 minutes or less. In this installment I will discuss the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are a group of structures found deep within the cerebral hemispheres and the brainstem that include the caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus. The caudate and putamen are often referred to collectively as the striatum, and the globus pallidus and substantia nigra are each made up of multiple nuclei. Although there are a variety of nonmotor functions associated with the basal ganglia, they are best known for their role in facilitating movement. Much of the information the basal ganglia receives comes from the cerebral cortex and travels first to the caudate or putamen, the main input nuclei of the basal ganglia. The globus pallidus and substantia nigra are the main output nuclei, and they send projections out from the basal ganglia to the cerebral cortex, mostly by way of the thalamus, as well as to nuclei in the brainstem.  Activity in the nuclei of the basal ganglia doesn't cause movement independently, but instead the basal ganglia influence activity in other areas of the brain like the motor cortex to affect movement. The ways in which the basal ganglia do this are not fully understood, but one hypothesis is that there are different circuits in the basal ganglia that promote and inhibit movement, respectively. According to this model, the main output of the basal ganglia is inhibitory and the neurons in the globus pallidus are constantly inhibiting the thalamus to prevent unwanted movements.  When a signal to initiate movement is sent from the cortex to the basal ganglia it follows a circuit in the basal ganglia known as the direct pathway, which leads to the silencing of neurons in the globus pallidus. This frees the thalamus from the inhibitory effects of the globus pallidus and allows movement to occur. There is also a circuit within the basal ganglia called the indirect pathway, which involves the subthalamic nucleus and leads to increased suppression of unwanted movements. It is thought that a balance between activity in these two pathways may allow for smooth movement. Reference: Mink JW. The basal ganglia: focused selection and inhibition of competing motor programs.

Lastly, I discuss the cerebellar peduncles as the routes by which the cerebellum communicates with the rest of the nervous system and the deep cerebellar nuclei as the primary output cells of the cerebellum. For an article (on my website) that explains the cerebellum, click this link: https://neuroscientificallychallenged... TRANSCRIPT: Welcome to 2 minute neuroscience, where I simplistically explain neuroscience topics in 2 minutes or less. In this installment I will discuss the cerebellum. Cerebellum is Latin for ``little brain,'' and the cerebellum does look like miniature version of the brain as it protrudes from under the posterior and inferior region of the cerebral cortex. Although the cerebellum has many functions, it is primarily associated with movement. Specifically, it seems to be involved with facilitating movement by detecting errors that occur in the course of a movement and correcting them, so the movement appears fluid and achieves its intended goal. The cerebellum is also involved with motor learning to reduce the likelihood errors in movement will occur again in the future. The cerebellum consists of two cerebellar hemispheres and can be divided into 3 parts. The cerebrocerebellum receives input from the cerebral cortex and is involved with planning and initiating movements. The spinocerebellum receives information about limb position and touch and pressure sensations from the spinal cord. The spinocerebellum uses this information, for example, to compare where a limb is in space with where it should be if the movement were going as planned. If there is a discrepancy, the spinocerebellum can modify motor signals to correct any errors in the movement. The vermis is the area of the spinocerebellum that runs along the midline of the cerebellum; it is involved with posture, limb movement, and eye movements. The vestibulocerebellum, also called the flocculonodular lobe, is important to maintaining equilibrium, balance, and posture.  The cerebellum communicates with the rest of the nervous system through three large pathways called the cerebellar peduncles, which include the superior, middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles.  When information is sent to the cerebellum, it takes an indirect path to reach extensively branched cells called Purkinje cells. These cells then project to a group of nuclei in the center of the cerebellum called the deep cerebellar nuclei. The deep cerebellar nuclei send the information to various areas in the brainstem and thalamus that then can influence motor areas of the cortex or descending motor tracts to modify movements.

I explain how the neural plate develops into the neural tube, and then the process by which the neural tube forms the brain and spinal cord. I discuss the primary (prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon) and secondary (telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, metencephalon, and myelencephalon) vesicles and what parts of the brain they will eventually form. For more neuroscience articles, videos, and a complete neuroscience glossary, check out my website at www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com ! TRANSCRIPT: Welcome to 2 minute neuroscience, where I simplistically explain neuroscience topics in 2 minutes or less. In this installment I will discuss early neural development. The development of the nervous system begins at around the third week of embryonic development, when an area of the ectoderm, or the outer tissue layer of the embryo, thickens and forms what is known as the neural plate.  This plate begins to fold inward, forming a groove called the neural groove. The sides of the neural groove, known as the neural folds, begin to come together. At the end of the third week, the folds will begin to fuse together. By the end of the fourth week, they have completely fused together to form the neural tube, which will eventually become the brain and spinal cord.  As the neural tube closes, bulges and bends begin to appear and they gradually become more noticeable. During the fourth week, there are three of these bulges present. They are called the primary vesicles. They are the prosencephalon, which will eventually form the cerebrum. The mesencephalon, which will eventually become the midbrain. And the rhombencephalon, which will eventually become the rest of the brainstem and the cerebellum. This end of the neural tube will form the spinal cord. As the brain continues to develop, two of these vesicles further subdivide to form secondary vesicles. The prosencephalon forms the telencephalon and diencephalon. The telencephalon will become the cerebral hemispheres, the diencephalon will eventually consist of thalamus, hypothalamus, and other structures. The mesencephalon does not subdivide any further and will become the midbrain. The rhombencephalon will subdivide into the metencephalon and myelencephalon. The metencephalon will become the pons and the cerebellum, and the myelencephalon will become the medulla. And the end of the neural tube will remain the spinal cord. Next, the neural tube will continue to develop to look more like the brain. The telencephalon will grow more rapidly than other parts of the tube and by 11 weeks, the brain will have a similar shape as to what it will at birth. Although it will continue to develop after birth, the brain at birth is structurally similar to a fully developed brain. REFERENCE: Nolte J.

For an article (on my website) that explains the motor cortex more in-depth, click this link: https://neuroscientificallychallenged... TRANSCRIPT: Welcome to 2 minute neuroscience, where I simplistically explain neuroscience topics in 2 minutes or less. In this installment I will discuss the motor cortex. The motor cortex is a region of cortex in the frontal lobe that is involved with voluntary movement. It is located anterior to a large sulcus called the central sulcus and is often divided into two major regions: the primary motor cortex and the nonprimary motor cortex. The primary motor cortex is found in the strip of cortex known as the precentral gyrus, which is located just anterior to the central sulcus. The primary motor cortex is arranged such that different parts of the region are associated with motor control of different parts of the body and thus is said to contain a motor map of the body.  Most of the neurons that travel from the primary motor cortex carrying signals regarding movement will enter one of two major motor pathways: the corticospinal or corticobulbar tract. The corticospinal tract carries movement-related signals to the spinal cord to cause movement of the body, while the corticobulbar tract carries signals to the brainstem to cause movement of the head, neck, and face. The nonprimary motor cortex is often divided into two main regions: the supplementary motor cortex and the premotor cortex. Although the functions of these areas are not well understood, it is thought the supplementary motor cortex may be involved with the execution of sequences of movement, the attainment of motor skills, and the selection of movements based on incoming sensory information. The premotor cortex contributes about 30\% of the neurons that enter the corticospinal tract, but seems to be more active during the planning of, rather than the execution of, movements.

TRANSCRIPT: Welcome to 2 minute neuroscience, where I simplistically explain neuroscience topics in 2 minutes or less. In this installment I will discuss the neuron.  This is a brain. Estimates vary but right now the best guess seems to be that our brains contain around 85 billion neurons. The neuron is a nerve cell and is the primary functional unit of the nervous system. This is a generic image of a neuron. Neurons actually come in all shapes and sizes but is the prototypical version of a neuron that you'll often see in a textbook. These structures extending from the left side of a neuron that look a little bit like tree branches are called dendrites. Dendrites are the area where neurons receive most of their information. There are receptors on dendrites that are designed to pick up signals from other neurons that come in the form of chemicals called neurotransmitters. Those signals picked up by dendrites cause electrical changes in a neuron that are interpreted in an area called the soma or the cell body. The soma contains the nucleus. The nucleus contains the DNA or genetic material of the cell. The soma takes all the information from the dendrites and puts it together in an area called the axon hillock. If the signal coming from the dendrites is strong enough then a signal is sent to the next part of the neuron called the axon. At this point the signal is called an action potential. The action potential travels down the axon which is covered with myelin, an insulatory material that helps to prevent the signal from degrading. The last step for the action potential is the axon terminals, also known as synaptic boutons. When the signal reaches the axon terminals it can cause the release of neurotransmitter. These purple structures represent the dendrites of another neuron. When a neurotransmitter is released from axon terminals, it interacts with receptors on the dendrites of the next neuron, and then the process repeats with the next neuron.

Though generally beneficial, PPIs however, may not be equally effective across cultures. We present evidence showing that certain types of PPIs may be less effective for Asians than those from Western cultures. Next, the article examines whether prosocial behavior may be a PPI that is universally beneficial and the possible explanations for its widespread benefits. Finally, we proceed to propose how the current repertoire of PPIs may be expanded to include new types that may be more suited for those in collectivistic cultures. Synthesizing across these areas, this article concludes with suggestions on how PPIs can be adapted for use across cultures, as well as future directions for the field of PPIs.},

  abstract = {Governments and public health institutions across the globe have set social distancing and stay-at-home guidelines to battle the COVID-19 pandemic. With reduced opportunities to spend time together in person come new challenges to remain socially connected. This essay addresses how the pandemic has changed people's use of digital communication methods, and how inequalities in the use of these methods may arise. We draw on data collected from 1,374 American adults between 4 and 8 April 2020, about two weeks after lockdown measures were introduced in various parts of the United States. We first address whether people changed their digital media use to reach out to friends and family, looking into voice calls, video calls, text messaging, social media, and online games. Then, we show how age, gender, living alone, concerns about Internet access, and Internet skills relate to changes in social contact during the pandemic. We discuss how the use of digital media for social connection during a global public health crisis may be unequally distributed among citizens and may continue to shape inequalities even after the pandemic is over. Such insights are important considering the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's social wellbeing. We also discuss how changes in digital media use might outlast the pandemic, and what this means for future communication and media research.},

Working with clients' (and our own) character strengths boosts well-being, fosters resilience, improves relationships, and creates strong, supportive cultures in our practices, classrooms, and organizations. This unique guide brings together the vast experience of the author with the science and the practice of positive psychology in such a way that both new and experienced practitioners will benefit. New practitioners will learn about the core concepts of character and signature strengths and how to fine-tune their approach and troubleshoot. Experienced practitioners will deepen their knowledge about advanced topics such as strengths overuse and collisions, hot button issues, morality, and integrating strengths with savoring, flow, and mindfulness. Hands-on practitioner tips throughout the book provide valuable hints on how to take a truly strengths-based approach. The 24 summary sheets spotlighting each of the universal character strengths are an indispensable resource for client sessions, succinctly summarizing the core features of and research on each strength. 70 evidence-based step-by-step activity handouts can be given to clients to help them develop character strengths awareness and use, increase resilience, set and meet goals, develop positive relationships, and find meaning and engagement in their daily lives. No matter what kind of practitioner you are, this one-of-a-kind field guide is a goldmine in science-based applications. You'll be able to immediately bring the science of well-being into action!

In his talk he discusses the significance of worldviews in our lives and what they do to us. During his student years, he studied psychology and philosophy in parallel and it was in the intersection of these two subjects that the idea of the importance of world views grew. He learned to know that the research available regarding people's world views was fragmented, unsystematic and lacked a holistic approach despite its significance in people's lives. In 2013 he wrote his dissertation on "The psychology of worldviews: Toward a non-reductive science of personality" and is now trying to establish ``The psychology of world views'' as a field of research.

  abstract = {The Nordic model comprises the economic and social policies as well as typical cultural practices common in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden). This includes a comprehensive welfare state and multi-level collective bargaining based on the economic foundations of social corporatism, and a commitment to private ownership within a market-based mixed economy -- with Norway being a partial exception due to a large number of state-owned enterprises and state ownership in publicly listed firms. Although there are significant differences among the Nordic countries, they all have some common traits. The three Scandinavian countries are constitutional monarchies, while Finland and Iceland have been republics since the 20th century. All the Nordic countries are however described as being highly democratic and all have a unicameral legislature and use proportional representation in their electoral systems. They all support a universalist welfare state aimed specifically at enhancing individual autonomy and promoting social mobility, with a sizable percentage of the population employed by the public sector (roughly 30\% of the work force in areas such as healthcare, education, and government), and a corporatist system with a high percentage of the workforce unionized and involving a tripartite arrangement, where representatives of labour and employers negotiate wages and labour market policy is mediated by the government. As of 2020, all of the Nordic countries rank highly on the inequality-adjusted HDI and the Global Peace Index as well as being ranked in the top 10 on the World Happiness Report. The Nordic model was originally developed in the 1930s under the leadership of social democrats, although centrist and right-wing political parties, as well as labour unions, also contributed to the Nordic model's development. The Nordic model began to gain attention after World War II and has transformed in some ways over the last few decades, including increased deregulation and expanding privatization of public services. However, it is still distinguished from other models by the strong emphasis on public services and social investment.},

Cet article fourni un test d'un argument d{\'e}riv{\'e} de l'{\'e}conomie politique des perspectives de vieillissement qui sugg{\`e}re qu'une acceptation {\'e}tendue d'un sc{\'e}nario de crise de vieillissement de la population pr{\'e}disposerait les agents {\`a} accepter certaines politiques que seraient autrement ind{\'e}sirables. De plus, un test de la th{\`e}se de McDaniel (1987) propose que le vieillissement de la population soit devenu un 'paradigme' ayant le potentiel pour influencer la discussion sur le choix de politiques. Les donn{\'e}es sont tir{\'e}es d'un sondage datant de 1989 d'un {\'e}chantillon repr{\'e}sentatif des r{\'e}sidents adultes d'Edmonton en Alberta (n = 443). Les r{\'e}sultats sugg{\`e}rent que la perception largement partag{\'e}e est que le Canada aura de la difficult{\'e} dans le futur de supporter sa population {\^a}g{\'e}e. De plus, le public semble pr{\^e}t {\`a} accepter une taxation accrue, il est divis{\'e} sur la question de cibler les b{\'e}n{\'e}fices vers les personnes {\^a}g{\'e}es {\`a} revenus modestes et il s'oppose aux coupures syst{\'e}matiques appliqu{\'e}es au niveau des b{\'e}n{\'e}fices vers{\'e}s aux personnes {\^a}g{\'e}es. S'ajoutant {\`a} ceci, les donn{\'e}es sugg{\`e}rent qu'une acceptation du sc{\'e}nario de crise est associ{\'e}e avec un empressement d'accepter des changements de politiques tels que des niveaux de taxation accrus et le ciblage de paiements de pensions de vieillesse. Ces r{\'e}sultats sont compatibles avec l'{\'e}conomie politique des perspectives de vieillissement et supporte, en g{\'e}n{\'e}ral, les propos de McDaniel (1987): que le vieillissement de la population a largement {\'e}t{\'e} d{\'e}fini comme un 'paradigme'. Enfin, {\'e}tant donn{\'e} que les attitudes ne variaient pas significativement selon l'{\^a}ge, ces r{\'e}sultats ne supportent pas l'argument que le vieillissement de la population entra{\^i}ne n{\'e}cessairement des conflits interr{\'e}gionaux. /// This study examines the extent to which the general public anticipates a future crisis regarding Canada's ability to provide economic support for its aging population and analyses public opinion regarding policy alternatives designed to either increase revenues or reduce expenditures for seniors. This paper provides a test of an argument derived from the political economy of aging perspective which suggests that widespread acceptance of the population aging crisis scenario predisposes the public to accept policy options that might otherwise be undesirable. Furthermore, a test is provided of McDaniel's (1987) thesis that population aging has become a dominant problem 'paradigm' with a potential for influencing public policy discussion. The data are drawn from a 1989 survey of a representative sample of the adult residents of Edmonton, Alberta (n = 443). The findings suggest there is a widely shared perception that Canada in the future will have difficulty supporting its elderly population. Furthermore, the public appears to be willing to accept increased taxation, is divided on the issue of targeting benefits to lower income seniors, and is opposed to across-the-board cuts in the levels of benefits paid to seniors. In addition, the data suggest that acceptance of the crisis scenario is associated with a willingness to accept policy changes such as increased levels of taxation and the targeting of old age security benefits. These findings are consistent with the political economy of aging perspective and are generally supportive of McDaniel's (1987) argument that population aging has been widely defined as a problem 'paradigm'. Finally, given that attitudes did not vary significantly by age, the findings do not support the argument that population aging necessarily leads to interfenerational conflict.},

Case studies and questionnaires provide students with practical examples and opportunities to deepen their understanding of their own leadership style. Key Features: A consistent chapter structure outlines each approach, how it works, and the major studies behind it, followed by an analysis of the strengths and criticisms for each approach Three case studies in each chapter help students to apply leadership theories in real-world scenarios. Questionnaires within each chapter provides self-assessment and reflection opportunities for each theory presented. New to This Edition: New Chapter on Inclusive Leadership provides a model of inclusive leadership that examines antecedent conditions, leader behaviors, and positive organizational outcomes associated with inclusive leadership 18 new real-world case studies profile leaders around the globe including cases on New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, a mental health program in Zimbabwe, and how a university in the US responds to crisis.

Still, the importance of understanding how leadership works and the value of competent leadership in times of crisis remain high. To that end, this edition is written to bridge the gap between the often-simplistic popular approaches to leadership and the more abstract theoretical approaches. Like previous editions, this tenth edition reviews and analyzes a selected number of leadership theories, giving special attention to how each theoretical approach can be applied in real-world organizations. In essence, my purpose is to explore how leadership theory can inform and direct the way leadership is practiced in real-life settings"-- Provided by publisher},

  year = 2017,

  abstract = {This week we learn about a famous but often misunderstood principle in philosophy, and how we can use this principle to help guide us in choosing appropriate models and theories. Follow us on social media: Twitter: ~~/~occamanswers~~ Facebook: ~~/~occams-answers-1609580059112636~~ Reddit: ~~/~occamsanswers~~ ------------------------------------------ Occam refers to William of Ockham, a 14th century English logician and theologian. A ``razor'' in philosophy is a guiding principle that helps philosophers ``shave away'' unlikely or unuseful explanations for a phenomenon. In the case of Occam's razor, overly complicated explanations are shaved away. More directly, if two competing explanations, theories, or models explain the same phenomenon equally well, philosophers generally prefer the explanation that makes the fewest assumptions. William of Ockham was not the first to propose such a principle, as it was famously used by Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas, and other philosophers before him. He did, however, use the principle in much of his philosophical work, and thus the razor became associated with him. It is important to note that Occam's razor does not make any claim about which of two competing theories is actually true, or which will continue to explain the phenomenon as new data is uncovered. Rather, it is a rule of thumb that guides scientists and philosophers when developing and choosing between models and theories. It is particularly effective against the tendency to add assumptions (called ad hoc hypotheses) to an older theory to make it fit with new conflicting evidence. A good example of Occam's razor at work concerns the debate between the geocentric and heliocentric models of the solar system. The goal of both models was to explain the motion of the planets as seen from earth. The geocentric model began with each planet following a simple orbit around the earth. However, it was later observed that the inner planets did not simply move across the sky but danced with the sun in a complicated pattern. The outer planets even appeared to turn around and move backward for a brief period in their orbit, before continuing through the sky. Furthermore, the planets moved at different speeds throughout their path. The geocentric model used ad hoc hypotheses to account for these new observations, assuming that the planets orbited on epicycles which themselves orbited the earth, or rather, a point very close to the earth, and that their speed was constant about a third point slightly farther from the earth. When still more discrepancies were observed, more epicycles were added until the model was thoroughly over-complicated. Meanwhile, the heliocentric model more elegantly explained all the observed phenomena by assuming all planets move in elliptical orbits around the sun. Occam's razor supports this model, which continues to explain newly observed stellar phenomena even today. There are many other instances in which Occam's razor supported a successful scientific theory. For example, quantum mechanics and special relativity were both huge departures from previous theories in an effort to avoid extraneous or ad hoc hypotheses. Even before the empirical success of Occam's razor, the idea drew support due to its aesthetic appeal. St. Thomas Aquinas, Newton, and Galileo all remarked that simplicity was inherently natural and desirable, and physicist Paul Dirac believed that theorists should strive for the mathematical beauty that often accompanies simplicity. Scientists and philosophers alike agree that all theories must be understandable and testable to be successful, therefore pragmatically speaking a model with fewer assumptions and complications is easier to work with. While opponents of Occam's razor argue that it is subjective and stifles creativity, its successes have earned it a place as a cornerstone of modern philosophy and scientific thinking.}

This paper describes several technology facilitated authentic learning designs that involve the development and support of learning communities. The learning designs are represented in several forms to provide an overview of the various elements in the learning setting and to indicate the learning and teaching strategies associated with the community development and support. The paper illustrates the different purposes learning design representations can serve and argues the need for further research, in particular, design-based research, to develop standard forms of representations that can be widely used to provide descriptions that support discovery and reuse.

Further, main effects of the communication medium were found for team psychological states and decision behavior. Results suggest that virtual teams were at a disadvantage when the task was framed as having a demonstrably correct solution. Conversely, face-to-face teams were more effective, particularly when told that the task had a demonstrably correct solution. Face-to-face teams were more effective on all decision behaviors.

  abstract = {Build your AI transformation Strategy in 30 Days 🚀 \ding{221} https://onstrategyhq.com/ai-contact-2/ What are core values? Before we learn how to write core values, we must understand what they are. Core values are beliefs or guiding principles that support an organization to ensure they are on track to fulfilling their mission or goals. They create a foundation and help to dictate strategies and practices. Let's dive into the anatomy of a core value. Load your labels before the colon, using the value as a noun. Then, we start with a verb in the present tense, insert the unique value to your organization, and end with the behavior you expect. The most important part of a core value is the behavior you expect. By constructing these values, you are stating how you wish everyone in your organization to behave. Make sure your core values are concrete and represent your business accurately. We do this by evaluating them. They should be your non-negotiables. Is this how you want everybody to act in your organization? Will you stand by them no matter what happens? Is the behavior clear? Shoot for five to seven core values. Now that you know how to write core values, we need to put them to use. Publish your values (posters, intranet, etc.), reinforce them at the beginning of staff meetings, and establish intentional experiences that strengthen a core value.  Core values are essential to a successful organization. Be clear on your expectations and stand by them. The better your team can understand and represent your values, the more you'll be able to work toward your mission and accomplish your goals.

It answers the question, why do we exist? Generally, you'll write a mission statement after you've developed your SWOT and before you go into the rest of the planning process. It defines the space where you play. Start with the phrase, ``our mission.'' Then, include a verb in the present tense, explain what you do (and for whom), and conclude with the overall benefit. The example on our board of Google's mission statement is relatively straightforward, and while they aren't always simple to write, follow our checklist for further guidance: \ding{108} Be original \ding{108} Make it foundational to your business - something that will sustain over time and not be changed \ding{108} Ensure staff connection - provides a purpose to your staff \ding{108} Keep it memorable - be short and concise  \ding{108} Can it fit on a t-shirt? If not, keep reworking it until it does! Gather staff input via survey or focus group. They have valuable insight and can help bring ideas to the surface. Create three to four versions of your statement that play on these ideas. Take those versions and have your team pick one or put it to a vote.

Vision statements are a critical component of any great strategic plan. Strategic plans are about creating a different future, and that future is articulated in your vision statement. It needs to be brief, clear, and understandable while painting a picture of where you are going and why. Mission and vision statements often get confused. The big difference is ``where.'' Where is your organization going? What does success for your organization in the future look like? The three types of vision statements are quantitative, competitive, and superlative. Use our checklist to help you write a vision statement: \ding{108} Focus on five or more years into the future \ding{108} Write in the future tense \ding{108} Make sure it's directional \ding{108} Be audacious (think big!) \ding{108} Be descriptive We love beginning our statements with the phrase, ``we envision.'' It's a solid start to writing in the future tense and shifts your focus to thinking ahead. Next, outline your impact. What's different, and how will you be impacting your community and beyond? Finally, what are your objectives and goals?  Leaders focus on vision. You can't lead if you don't have a vision.

  journal = {Wikipedia},
  abstract = {Organizational theory refers to a series of interrelated concepts that involve the sociological study of the structures and operations of formal social organizations. Organizational theory also seeks to explain how interrelated units of organization either connect or do not connect with each other. Organizational theory also concerns understanding how groups of individuals behave, which may differ from the behavior of an individual. The behavior organizational theory often focuses on is goal-directed. Organizational theory covers both intra-organizational and inter-organizational fields of study. In the early 20th century, theories of organizations initially took a rational perspective but have since become more diverse. In a rational organization system, there are two significant parts: Specificity of Goals and Formalization. The division of labor is the specialization of individual labor roles, associated with increasing output and trade. Modernization theorist Frank Dobbin wrote that "modern institutions are transparently purposive and that we are in the midst of an extraordinary progression towards more efficiency." Max Weber's conception of bureaucracy is characterized by the presence of impersonal positions that are earned and not inherited, rule-governed decision-making, professionalism, chain of command, defined responsibility, and bounded authority. Contingency theory holds that an organization must try to maximize performance by minimizing the effects of various environmental and internal constraints, and that the ability to navigate this requisite variety may depend upon the development of a range of response mechanisms. Dwight Waldo in 1978 wrote that "[o]rganization theory is characterized by vogues, heterogeneity, claims and counterclaims." Organization theory cannot be described as an orderly progression of ideas or a unified body of knowledge in which each development builds carefully on and extends the one before it. Rather, developments in theory and descriptions for practice show disagreement about the purposes and uses of a theory of organization, the issues to which it should address itself (such as supervisory style and organizational culture), and the concepts and variables that should enter into such a theory. Suggestions to view organizations as a series of logical relationships between its participants have found its way into the theoretical relationships between diverging organizational theories as well, as explains the interdisciplinary nature of the field.},

Pastor, author, and leadership consultant, Larry Osborne has discovered this to be the case with instruction on how to be a good leader. The best, most practical advice comes from the Bible, and in particular, 1 Peter 5:1-4. It's in this short passage where leaders are exhorted toshepherdthe flock among them. Unfortunately, most modern leaders have precious little experience tending sheep, and many of the implications that were well understood when Peter penned these words are lost on today's reader. Osborne finds the parallels to be numerous, well-worth reviewing and understanding anew. A shepherd leads them to water even when they fear it. A shepherd never allows one sick lamb to destroy the flock. A shepherd lays down his life for his sheep ... When leaders truly understand Peter's words of exhortation to lead like a shepherd, then they will begin to see the path that leads them to Leading Well},

  abstract = {Inside Out is a 2015 American animated coming-of-age film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. It was directed by Pete Docter from a screenplay he co-wrote with Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley. The film stars the voices of Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Richard Kind, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling, Kaitlyn Dias, Diane Lane, and Kyle MacLachlan. Inside Out follows the inner workings of the mind of Riley, a young girl who adapts to her family's relocation as five personified emotions administer her thoughts and actions. Docter conceived Inside Out in October 2009 after observing changes in his daughter's personality as she grew older. The project was subsequently green-lit, and Docter and co-director Ronnie del Carmen developed the story, while consulting psychologists and neuroscientists in an effort to accurately portray the mind. Development took five-and-a-half years on a budget of approximately \$175 million. Significant changes to the film's story and characters delayed the film's production schedule. Inside Out debuted at the 68th Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2015, and was released in the United States on June 19. It received critical acclaim for its craftsmanship, screenplay, subject matter, plot, and vocal performances---particularly those of Poehler, Smith, Kind, Hader, Kaling, and Black. The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named Inside Out one of the top-ten films of 2015. It grossed \$858.8 million worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2015. The film was nominated for two awards at the 88th Academy Awards, winning Best Animated Feature, and received numerous other accolades. Philosophical journal Film and Philosophy recognized Inside Out as one of the best animated films ever made. A sequel, Inside Out 2, was released in 2024.},

Over the past decade, advances in systematic review methodology and terminology have necessitated an update to the guideline. The PRISMA 2020 statement replaces the 2009 statement and includes new reporting guidance that reflects advances in methods to identify, select, appraise, and synthesise studies. The structure and presentation of the items have been modified to facilitate implementation. In this article, we present the PRISMA 2020 27-item checklist, an expanded checklist that details reporting recommendations for each item, the PRISMA 2020 abstract checklist, and the revised flow diagrams for original and updated reviews.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Experiment 1A showed motivated reasoning: participants were more likely to endorse the use of sweatshop labor when considering a Caribbean vacation with questionable labor practices for themselves than for their friends. Experiment 1B demonstrated that endorsement of sweatshop labor mediated the relationship between product desirability and purchase intention. Experiment 2 found that cognitive resources were recruited to enhance motivated reasoning regarding sweatshop labor, the latter of which was reduced under cognitive load. Experiments 3A and 3B found that when cognitive resources were specifically directed in a comparative joint evaluation, participants offered harsher views on the ethicality of a favored company, and were less influenced by motivated factors than when under separate evaluations.},

  abstract = {Background. Benner's account of meaning and embodiment in nursing depends on a theory which she has never fully articulated, although she makes numerous allusions to it. Behind the background of shared meanings hovers something called `culture', which provides each individual with meaning, determines what counts as real for her, and actively hands down interpretation-laden practices. This view is based, Benner claims, on the Heideggerian assumption that the meaning and organization of a culture precedes individual meaning-giving activity. Aim. I explore Benner's implicit view of culture, drawing on her published work over 15 years, and offer an appraisal of it. In doing so, I attempt to make sense of some rather strange remarks Benner has recently made about `remnants' of Cartesian and Kantian thinking being found in the everyday understandings of people with asthma. Methods. The concept of culture is developed with reference to both Benner's own work and that of the anthropologist, Clifford Geertz, whose work she frequently cites. Having identified the principal tenets of what we might conveniently call the Benner--Geertz theory, I proceed to interrogate the theory, using the recent anthropological literature -- and, in particular, materialist attacks on the idea of culture as a system of meanings -- in order to cast doubt on it. I also review, very briefly, an alternative way of understanding `culture', which is not vulnerable to the same criticisms. Conclusions. Benner's implicit theory of culture is revealed, somewhat ironically, as an inverted form of Cartesian dualism. Its intellectual provenance is not Heidegger, who appears to reject it, but the sort of American sociology associated with Talcott Parsons. As a corollary, it is suggested that Benner's `remnants' analogy cannot be justified, and that the idea of Cartesian and Kantian concepts permeating Western culture, infecting both the providers and receivers of health care, is a myth.},

Though they have been claimed to have positive effects on students' learning, these effects have not been meta-analyzed. Our aim was to synthesize the effects of rubrics on academic performance, self-regulated learning, and self-efficacy. The moderator effect of the following variables was also investigated: year of publication, gender, mean age, educational level, type of educational level (compulsory vs. higher education), number of sessions, number of assessment criteria, number of performance levels, use of self and peer assessment, research design, and empirical quality of the study. Standardized mean differences (for the three outcomes) and standardized mean changes (SMC; for academic performance) were calculated from the retrieved studies. After correcting for publication bias, a moderate and positive effect was found in favor of rubrics on academic performance (g\,=\,0.45, k\,=\,21, m\,=\,54, 95\% CI [0.312, 0.831]; SMC\,=\,0.38, 95\% CI [0.02, 0.75], k\,=\,12, m\,=\,30), whereas a small pooled effect was observed for self-regulated learning (g\,=\,0.23, k\,=\,5, m\,=\,17, 95\% CI [-0.15, 0.60]) and for self-efficacy (g\,=\,0.18, k\,=\,3, m\,=\,5, 95\% CI [-0.81, 0.91]). Most of the moderator variables were not significant. Importantly, to improve the quality of future reports on the effects of rubrics, we provide an instrument to be filled out for rubric scholars in forthcoming studies.},

Research shows that teachers and principals are leaving the profession of education at alarming rates. Some of the causes stem from the rising expectations and demands that educators find difficult to manage. Unfortunately, for many educators, taking care of others often means neglecting their own health and well-being. How can educators continue doing work they love while also making sure they are protecting themselves in the process? William D. Parker has served schools for more than twenty-five years as a teacher, administrator and education consultant. In Pause. Breathe. Flourish., he provides practical strategies and common-sense approaches for taking better care of yourself so that you can better serve and lead others. Each chapter begins with a mental image and unpacks specific tips for cultivating personal or professional growth. In the pages ahead, you will discover how your thoughts, relationships, commitments, values, and habits play an essential role in who you are as a person. Understanding 'who you are' plays heavily in your ability to weather storms, maintain perspective, work with purpose and effect meaningful change in the lives of others. Applying those insights can be challenging. By reading this book, you will be challenged to reconsider your mindset, reading habits, personal health, financial commitments, relationship priorities, and legacy building. To help you move forward, each chapter ends with reflection questions so that you can take immediate actions for thoughtful application and improved outcomes. Don't become another statistic in the rising number of educators who feel burned out. Instead, reimagine the possibilities that can happen for yourself and those whom you serve when you take time to pause, breathe, and flourish!},

The scales and paragraphs were formed into an online survey, reviewed by an expert panel, and distributed to 56 randomly selected contacts where 514 participants responded.Through discriminant analysis, five statistically significant (p=0.000) discriminant items were found that differentiated between transformational and servant leadership.The paper proposes that the five statistically significant items revealed by the first author's research be brought into future definitions, discussions, and research on transformational and/or servant leadership.The five items proposed should also be integrated into leadership and organizational development practices, the literature, and future research.The paper discusses the first empirical research study investigating the distinctions between transformational and servant leaders, two leadership styles that have existed and been discussed by scholars and theorists since the 1970s.},

  abstract = {Psychological flow can be experienced in various occupational, recreational and creative domains and may confer increased well-being. Yet, very few studies have examined flow as a potential feature of creative arts therapies -- particularly therapies which prioritise embodied/enactive processes. This study tested the acute effects of a 90-minute workshop (Arts for the Blues; A4B) on participants' (N = 18) mood and personal goal attainment. Psychological flow was measured, and participants rated the importance of flow in relation to A4B's psychotherapeutic aims. Results show significantly improved mood, increased goal attainment and substantial flow scores, suggesting that A4B processes may invoke flow. Participants' importance ratings of different flow dimensions indicate that some were considered as more important than others. Results are discussed in relation to methodological limitations, helpful creative therapeutic factors that may enable flow, and implications for researchers and practitioners who wish to encourage flow in their practice.},

The predominant crisis communication approach involves defensive posturing, image restoration and corporate apologia strategies to protect and defend organizations in crisis. Some organizations, however, engage in crisis discourse that focuses on evolution and growth instead of issues like blame and liability. This paper employs Robert Ulmer, Timothy Sellnow and Matthew Seeger's discourse of renewal to examine Starbucks' crisis response to the April 12, 2018, arrests of two black men waiting for a friend in one of the coffee chain's Philadelphia locations. While Starbucks has not characterized it as such, the organization demonstrated a renewing response. Through the Starbucks case, this paper illustrates how crises challenge organizational practices and offer platforms for organizational rebirth, development and long-term survival. Through Kantian ethics, this paper suggests duty-driven responsibilities for enacting renewal discourse and practical implications.},

  abstract = {Spirituality has long been considered a dimension of holistic palliative care. However, conceptualizations of spirituality are in transition in the nursing literature. No longer rooted within religion, spirituality is increasingly being defined by the universal search for meaning, connectedness, energy, and transcendence. To be human is to be spiritual. Some have argued that the concept of spirituality in the nursing literature has become so generic that it is no longer meaningful. A conceptualization that attempts to be all-encompassing of what it means to live a human life has a tendency to render invisible the differences that make life meaningful. For palliative patients in particular, a generic approach may obscure and relativize the important values and beliefs that inform the critical questions that many patients grapple with at end of life. A different approach to conceptualizing spirituality can be achieved through the use of typologies. Rather than obscuring difference, categories are constructed to illuminate how spirituality is understood within a diverse society and how those understandings might influence patient-provider relationships. What follows in this article is a dialogue illustrating one typology of spirituality constructed from a review of selected nursing literature. The hypothetical narrator and three participants, representing the positions of theism, monism, and humanism, discuss their understandings of spirituality and religion, and how those understandings influence the intersections between nursing ontology, epistemology, and spiritual care.},

  abstract = {On ancient maps unexplored lands were simply labeled 'there be dragons' indicating the fear that attends the unknown. Despite three decades of theoretical and empirical work on spirituality in nursing, evidence still suggests that nurses do not feel competent to engage in spiritual care. In this paper I propose that one of the reasons for this is a theory-theory gap between religion and spirituality. Generalized anxiety about the role of religion in society has led to under-theorizing in nursing about religious care. As a result, when religion and spirituality overlap at the point of care, nurses are left without the substantive knowledge required for practice. Robust religious theorizing should include thick accounts of lived religion and integrative work that enables nurses to understand commonalities across religions that are relevant to practice. As a starting point to this integrative work, nurses can be introduced to the nature and lexicon of lived religion, religious perspectives on suffering, and religious reasoning that holds meaning and mystery in tension. Such an approach will better prepare them for the realities of practice where the complexities of spirituality and religion come to play.},

  abstract = {'Character'has become a front-and-center topic in contemporary discourse, but this term does not have a fixed meaning. Character may be simply defined by what someone does not do, but a more active and thorough definition is necessary, one that addresses certain vital questions. Is character a singular characteristic of an individual, or is it composed of different aspects? Does character--however we define it--exist in degrees, or is it simply something one happens to have? How can character be developed? Can it be learned? Relatedly, can it be taught, and who might be the most effective teacher? What roles are played by family, schools, the media, religion, and the larger culture? This groundbreaking handbook of character strengths and virtues is the first progress report from a prestigious group of researchers who have undertaken the systematic classification and measurement of widely valued positive traits. They approach good character in terms of separate strengths-authenticity, persistence, kindness, gratitude, hope, humor, and so on-each of which exists in degrees. Character Strengths and Virtues classifies twenty-four specific strengths under six broad virtues that consistently emerge across history and culture: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. Each strength is thoroughly examined in its own chapter, with special attention to its meaning, explanation, measurement, causes, correlates, consequences, and development across the life span, as well as to strategies for its deliberate cultivation. This book demands the attention of anyone interested in psychology and what it can teach about the good life.},

This function is mediated by the leader's constructive development and meta-belief and moderated by the organizational context and leadership style. This framework provides a starting point for considering the many expressions of spirituality in organizations and serves as a foundation for a multi-level theory of spirituality and leadership.},

  abstract = {Phishing is a form of social engineering and a scam where attackers deceive people into revealing sensitive information or installing malware such as viruses, worms, adware, or ransomware. Phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and often transparently mirror the site being targeted, allowing the attacker to observe everything while the victim navigates the site, and transverses any additional security boundaries with the victim. As of 2020, it is the most common type of cybercrime, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Internet Crime Complaint Center reporting more incidents of phishing than any other type of cybercrime. The term "phishing" was first recorded in 1995 in the cracking toolkit AOHell, but may have been used earlier in the hacker magazine 2600. It is a variation of fishing and refers to the use of lures to "fish" for sensitive information. Measures to prevent or reduce the impact of phishing attacks include legislation, user education, public awareness, and technical security measures. The importance of phishing awareness has increased in both personal and professional settings, with phishing attacks among businesses rising from 72\% in 2017 to 86\% in 2020, already rising to 94\% in 2023.},

In three separate studies conducted in diverse organizational contexts, it was found that, while overall participants exhibited a preference for soft over hard social influence tactics, this preference becomes less pronounced for supervisors high (versus low) on need for closure and becomes more pronounced for supervisors low on the need for closure. Overall, soft tactics were more beneficial for subordinates' performance than hard tactics; however, the benefits of soft tactics decreased as a function of subordinates' need for closure. Finally, organizational outcomes were improved when recipients who were high (versus low) on the need for closure were exposed to ``hard'' power tactics and those low (versus high) in the need for closure were exposed to ``soft'' tactics.

Quantitative analyses on conduct exhibited by instructors and students in discussion forums from 303 online classrooms in a variety of disciplines revealed a positive association of students' cognitive engagement and instructors' behavioral engagement with the depth of the discussion prompts. Both cognitive and behavioral measures of students' engagement decreased with increased class size. For instructors, as class size increased, behavioral engagement decreased, and cognitive engagement increased. Grades improved with students' emotional engagement but declined with instructors' cognitive engagement. These idiosyncratic patterns of relationships suggest the need for further inquiry into the unique aspects of instruction in the asynchronous online classroom.},

  abstract = {The Coronavirus advance is forcing schools and universities to revise their teaching methodologies. With the closure of the institutions, thousands of teachers and millions of students will have to find new ways of teaching and learning overnight, which will be a huge challenge. We cannot expect everyone to suddenly adapt to these new times. We are aware of the numerous Internet connection problems, but it is a great time to reinvent ourselves and build the courage to test the use of technological tools already available to structure alternatives in the distance education format. Thinking outside the box can help mitigate the momentary problem, as well as collaborate to strengthen digital culture and move towards a new education.The good news is that many teachers have been putting aside prejudices and are being resilient, seeking to understand the potential of available resources, not shying away from seeking and implementing technological solutions that before the virus were seen as secondary and have now become standard tools to teach synchronous and asynchronous classes, share content, correct assignments, answer questions and exchange knowledge. In the beginning, many activities that were previously carried out exclusively in person took a longer time when they started to be performed online. But as the virtual became the new real, students became more engaged and plunged headlong into relevant online learning experiences. Through applications and software, classes continued according to the school calendar.This study aimed to understand how teachers adapted to digital resources to face the limitations caused by the pandemic. It also intends to understand the impact of digital resources on the quality of teaching, as well as on motivation and academic success.},

Objections to the dominance of evidence-based practice are reviewed, and the reasons for it are examined. It is argued that it is partially the result of weaknesses in the alternative patterns of ethical, personal, and esthetic knowing, the ineffability of which compromises accountability. This ineffability can be countered only by introducing a wider form of empirics than countenanced by evidence-based practice into all patterns of knowing, to demonstrate their salience and to make their use in practice transparent.},

For adult survivors of childhood trauma, experiences related to shame, betrayal, meaning-making, and mourning often complicate their spiritual and/or religious beliefs. This article uses a clinical case example to introduce and illustrate the relevance of a particular complex trauma intervention framework in the context of spiritually-informed treatment with adult Christian clients. Component-Based Psychotherapy (CBP; Hopper, Grossman, Spinazzola, \& Zucker, in press) consists of four principal components: (a) relationship, (b) regulation, (c) parts work, and (d) narrative, and is predicated upon the importance of client-therapist parallel process to therapeutic movement and client change. Each treatment component is summarized and practically applied to case material, with particular focus on the ways in which client's faith beliefs and practices can serve as a potential resource and/or barrier in treatment. Particular integrative focus is given to the final treatment component (narrative), where issues of a client's lament, spiritual meaning making, and the therapist's potential vulnerabilities in working with this population are addressed.},

The guidelines we give TEDx organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/t... How do you beat back the bully inside your brain that weaves a web of lies telling you you're not good enough, successful enough? Lori Prichard walks us through her husband's struggle with depression that ultimately led him to take his own life. It was a struggle in which he suffered entirely alone having hidden his depression from those he loved. Lori shares the lessons she learned and the journals she found after her husband's death that gave her a window into how he was trying to fight off what he called "the bully in my brain." For those who are struggling with depression, Lori has an urgent message for you. Lori Prichard is the morning anchor for KSL TV. In 2019, she suddenly lost her beloved husband, Travis, to suicide. Since then, she has been an advocate for suicide prevention and the need to talk openly about depression. Lori has been with KSL TV since 2007 after moving to Utah with her husband from the Midwest. She holds an undergraduate degree in economics from Baylor University. She also received a master's degree in both journalism and public affairs from the University of Missouri. Lori spent a year studying abroad at the Sorbonne in Paris, France. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

We examined ways in which knowledge operates in the practice of home care nursing and explored how knowledge might be fruitfully understood within the ambiguous spaces and competing temporalities characterizing contemporary healthcare services. Two popular metaphors of knowledge in nursing practice were identified and critically examined; evidence-based practice and the nurse as an intuitive worker. Pointing to faults in these conceptualizations, we suggest a different way of conceptualizing the relationship between knowledge and practice, namely practice as being activated by contextualized knowledge. This conceptualization is captured in an understanding of the intelligent creation of context by the nurse for nursing practice to be ethical and effective.},

Academics, business experts, and even doctors make the case that purpose is a key to exceptional leadership and the pathway to greater well-being. Despite this growing understanding, however, a big challenge remains. Few leaders have a strong sense of their own individual purpose, the authors' research and experience show, and even fewer can distill their purpose into a concrete statement or have a clear plan for translating purpose into action. As a result, they limit their aspirations and often fail to achieve their most ambitious professional and personal goals. In this article, the authors present a step-by-step framework that leaders can use to identify their purpose and develop an impact plan to achieve concrete results. Effective purpose-to-impact plans use language that is uniquely meaningful to the individual, rather than business jargon. They focus on future, big-picture aspirations and work backward with increasing specificity. And they emphasize the individual's strengths and encourage a holistic view on work and family.},

Cultural diversity also brings challenges, however, and diversity research has identified the need to consider moderating influences in the diversity--performance relationship. Team leadership should be particularly important in this respect and drawing on a theoretical analysis that puts an understanding of cultural diversity center stage, we propose that factors that reflect leaders' experience with cultural diversity positively moderate the relationship between cultural diversity and team performance. We identify leader cultural background (local vs. foreign to the host culture) and leader team tenure as such factors. We predict that the influence of team nationality diversity (a form of cultural diversity) on team performance is more positive with a leader who is foreign to the host country than with a local leader, and with a leader with longer team tenure. In addition, we predict that the one moderating influence substitutes for the other, such that the effect of leader cultural background is stronger for leaders with shorter tenure with the team. Results from a survey of N\,=\,66 teams ( N\,=\,336 individuals) from a multinational company support these hypotheses and inform our discussion of ways forward in the study of leadership and team diversity.},

BACKGROUND: Self-awareness is important for the personal and professional development of nurses, for developing an effective nurse-patient relationship and for improving nursing abilities. Despite its importance in nursing and therapeutic nurse-patient relationship and its evolving nature, the knowledge base for self-awareness in nursing remains under-examined. DESIGN: A scoping review using PRISMA guidelines. METHODS: A five-step approach: (a) identification of research question; (b) identification of relevant studies using a three-step search: keywords search within PubMed and CINAHL, literature search within PubMed, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycINFO, Science Direct and Google Scholar, and literature search of references lists; (c) study selection; (d) data extraction and charting; (e) data collation, summarisation and reporting, was used. FINDINGS: Of 1,531 identified sources, 76 full-text sources were read and 29 English language sources, published from January 1980 until January 2018, which included nurses or nursing students, were reviewed. Two themes: perspectives on self-awareness and strategies for enhancing self-awareness emerged. Under these themes, conceptualisation of self-awareness; its antecedents and value; and theory-based, educational and personal strategies for its enhancement were described. There is sufficient literature regarding self-awareness conceptualisation and theory-based strategies for its enhancement, but inconclusive evidence regarding value of self-awareness, and educational and personal strategies for its improvement. CONCLUSION: There is limited research on self-awareness. Most of the literature comprises of theoretical discussions and opinions which adequately provide a conceptual understanding of self-awareness. However, more empirical and applied research is needed to apply the available theoretical knowledge in practice. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review delineated theoretical, educational and personal strategies for nurses to improve their self-awareness and indicated that engagement in self-awareness at relational and contextual levels is essential for developing nurse-patient relationship.},

It highlights the implications for treatment of focusing on the intact resources of the patient such as positive emotion, character strengths, positive relationships, and meaning, in order to optimize outcome. Character strengths, for the most part, do not diminish others; rather, they elevate those who witness the strength, producing admiration rather than jealousy. Psychiatric disorders are traditionally conceptualized in terms of the presence of symptoms. Positive psychology perspectives on education emphasize what is right with students, building their strengths, and enhancing their well-being. Positive psychology scholars are exploring a wide variety of new areas. There are several future directions for the field that can help to establish positive psychology as an important pillar of the mental health establishment, with meaningful and scientific suggestions on how to make life worth living.},

  abstract = {For over a century the focus of psychotherapy has been on what ails us, with the therapeutic process resting upon the assumption that unearthing past traumas, correcting faulty thinking, and restoring dysfunctional relationships is curative. And indeed, they are - but in the rush to identify and reduce symptoms of mental disorder, something important has been overlooked: the positives. Should enhancing well-being, and building upon character strengths and virtues, be explicit goals of therapy? Positive Psychotherapy provides therapists with a session-by-session therapeutic approach based on the principles of positive psychology, a burgeoning area of study examining the conditions and processes that enable individuals, communities, and institutions to flourish. This clinician's manual begins with an overview of the theoretical framework for positive psychotherapy, exploring character strengths and positive psychology practices, processes, and mechanisms of change. The second half of the book contains 15 positive psychotherapy sessions, each complete with core concepts, guidelines, skills, and worksheets for practicing skills learned in session. Each session also includes at least one vignette as well as discussion of cross-cultural implications. Mental health professionals of all orientations will find in Positive Psychotherapy a refreshing alternative to symptom-based approaches that will endow clients with a sense of purpose and meaning that many have found lacking in more traditional therapies.},

  abstract = {Each year, millions of men and women fall prey to depression. While the disorder has been called "psychiatry's most treatable condition," less than one in five get help. In recent years, the silence surrounding depression in women has begun to lift, but only now, with this powerful groundbreaking work, does psychotherapist Terrence Real expose a virtual epidemic of the disorder in men.Twenty years of experience treating men and their families has convinced Real that there are two forms of depression: "overt" and "covert." Feeling the stigma of depression's "unmanliness," many men hide their condition not only from family and friends but even from themselves. Attempts to escape depression fuel many of the problems we think of as typically male---difficulty with intimacy, workaholism, alcoholism, abusive behavior, and rage. By directing their pain outward, depressed men hurt the people they love, and, most tragically, pass their condition on to their children.A master storyteller, Real mixes penetrating analysis with poignant, compelling tales of the men and women whom he treats. He writes with passion and searing clarity about his own experiences with depression, as the son of a depressed, violent father, and the father of two young sons.Peggy Papp of the Ackerman Family Institute calls this book "a pathway out of the darkness." Real teaches us how men can unearth their pain, heal themselves, restore relationships, and break the legacy of abuse. I Don't Want to Talk About It offers great wisdom, hope, and practical guidance to men and their families. This is one of the most important and straightforward books ever written about men.},

School improvement can often feel like a losing battle, but it doesn't have to be. In this fully revised and updated second edition of The Learning Leader, Douglas B. Reeves helps leadership teams go beyond excuses to capitalize on their strengths, reduce their weaknesses, and reset their mindset and priorities to achieve unprecedented success. A critical key is recognizing student achievement as more than just a set of test scores. Reeves asserts that when leaders focus exclusively on results, they fail to measure and understand the importance of their own actions. He offers an alternative---the Leadership for Learning Framework, which helps leaders identify and distinguish among four different types of educators and provide more effective, tailored support to- "Lucky" educators, who achieve high results but don't understand how their actions influence achievement.- "Losing" educators, who achieve low results yet keep doing the same thing, expecting different outcomes.- "Learning" educators, who have not yet achieved the desired results but are working their way toward excellence.- "Leading" educators, who achieve high results and understand how their actions influence their success. Reeves stresses that effective leadership is neither a unitary skill nor a solitary activity. The Learning Leader helps leaders reconceptualize their roles in the school improvement process and motivate themselves and their colleagues to keep working to better serve their students.},

One of these political sites is that of religion, which to varying degrees continues to shape beliefs about health and illness, the delivery of healthcare services and the nurse-patient encounter. In this paper, I attempt to complicate nursing's views on religion and politics in healthcare, with the intent of thinking critically and philosophically about questions that arise at the intersection of religion, politics and nursing/healthcare. These questions include the following: What is the domain of religion and politics? How (non)religious are the contemporary societies in which nurses practice? What are the variations and implications of secularism? How is religion entangled with other intersecting social relations of power? How does a political reading of religion and politics matter to the concerns of nursing?},

  abstract = {Knowledge translation has been widely taken up as an innovative process to facilitate the uptake of research-derived knowledge into health care services. Drawing on a recent research project, we engage in a philosophic examination of how knowledge translation might serve as vehicle for the transfer of critically oriented knowledge regarding social justice, health inequities, and cultural safety into clinical practice. Through an explication of what might be considered disparate traditions (those of critical inquiry and knowledge translation), we identify compatibilities and discrepancies both within the critical tradition, and between critical inquiry and knowledge translation. The ontological and epistemological origins of the knowledge to be translated carry implications for the synthesis and translation phases of knowledge translation. In our case, the studies we synthesized were informed by various critical perspectives and hence we needed to reconcile differences that exist within the critical tradition. A review of the history of critical inquiry served to articulate the nature of these differences while identifying common purposes around which to strategically coalesce. Other challenges arise when knowledge translation and critical inquiry are brought together. Critique is one of the hallmark methods of critical inquiry and, yet, the engagement required for knowledge translation between researchers and health care administrators, practitioners, and other stakeholders makes an antagonistic stance of critique problematic. While knowledge translation offers expanded views of evidence and the complex processes of knowledge exchange, we have been alerted to the continual pull toward epistemologies and methods reminiscent of the positivist paradigm by their instrumental views of knowledge and assumptions of objectivity and political neutrality. These types of tensions have been productive for us as a research team in prompting a critical reconceptualization of knowledge translation.},

Criticality prompts us to examine taken-for-granted assumptions, such as the neutrality and universality of spirituality, while analyzing social relations of power, including the racialization of religion and religious patriarchy, that may result in oppressive conditions and social exclusion. The argument is made that when refracted through critical, intersectional lenses, religious and spiritual traditions can be rich sources of theoretical foundations and practical services that could inform nursing's recent re/turn toward social justice.},

  abstract = {Healthcare settings are notoriously complex places where life and death co-exist, and where suffering is an everyday occurrence, giving rise to existential questions. The full range of society's diversity is reflected in patients and staff. Increasing religious and ethnic plurality, alongside decades of secularizing trends, is bringing new attention to how religion and nonreligion are expressed in public spaces. Through critical ethnographic research in Vancouver and London, Prayer as Transgression? reveals how prayer occurs in hospitals, long-term care facilities, and community-based clinics in a variety of forms and circumstances. Prayer occurs quietly on the edges of day-to-day healthcare provision and in designated sacred spaces. Some requests for prayer, however, interrupt and transgress the clinical machinery of a hospital, such as when a patient asks for prayer from the chaplain while the operating room waits. With contributions by researchers, healthcare practitioners, and chaplains, the authors consider how prayer transgresses the clinical priorities that mark healthcare, opening up ways to think differently about institutional norms and social structures. They show how prayer highlights trends of secularization and sacralization in healthcare settings. They also consider the ambivalences about prayer arising from staff and patients' varied views on religion and spirituality, and their associated ethical concerns amidst clinical and workload demands. A window onto religion in the public sphere, Prayer as Transgression? tells much about how people live well together, even in the face of personal crises and fragilities, suffering, diversity, and social change.},

  journal = {Wikipedia},

  abstract = {The reliability of Wikipedia and its volunteer-driven and community-regulated editing model, particularly its English-language edition, has been questioned and tested. Wikipedia is written and edited by volunteer editors (known as Wikipedians) who generate online content with the editorial oversight of other volunteer editors via community-generated policies and guidelines. The reliability of the project has been tested statistically through comparative review, analysis of the historical patterns, and strengths and weaknesses inherent in its editing process. The online encyclopedia has been criticized for its factual unreliability, principally regarding its content, presentation, and editorial processes. Studies and surveys attempting to gauge the reliability of Wikipedia have mixed results. Wikipedia's reliability was frequently criticized in the 2000s but has been improved; its English-language edition has been generally praised in the late 2010s and early 2020s. Select assessments of its reliability have examined how quickly vandalism---content perceived by editors to constitute false or misleading information---is removed. Two years after the project was started, in 2003, an IBM study found that "vandalism is usually repaired extremely quickly---so quickly that most users will never see its effects". The inclusion of false or fabricated content has, at times, lasted for years on Wikipedia due to its volunteer editorship. Its editing model facilitates multiple systemic biases, namely selection bias, inclusion bias, participation bias, and group-think bias. The majority of the encyclopedia is written by male editors, leading to a gender bias in coverage, and the make up of the editing community has prompted concerns about racial bias, spin bias, corporate bias, and national bias, among others. An ideological bias on Wikipedia has also been identified on both conscious and subconscious levels. A series of studies from Harvard Business School in 2012 and 2014 found Wikipedia "significantly more biased" than Encyclop{\ae}dia Britannica but attributed the finding more to the length of the online encyclopedia as opposed to slanted editing. Instances of non-neutral or conflict-of-interest editing and the use of Wikipedia for "revenge editing" has attracted attention to false, biased, or defamatory content in articles, especially biographies of living people.  Articles on less technical subjects, such as the social sciences, humanities, and culture, have been known to deal with misinformation cycles, cognitive biases, coverage discrepancies, and editor disputes. The online encyclopedia does not guarantee the validity of its information.  It is seen as a valuable "starting point" for researchers when they pass over content to examine the listed references, citations, and sources. Academics suggest reviewing reliable sources when assessing the quality of articles. Its coverage of medical and scientific articles such as pathology, toxicology, oncology, pharmaceuticals, and psychiatry were compared to professional and peer-reviewed sources in a 2005 Nature study. A year later Encyclop{\ae}dia Britannica disputed the Nature study, whose authors, in turn, replied with a further rebuttal. Concerns regarding readability and the overuse of technical language were raised in studies published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (2011), Psychological Medicine (2012), and European Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). The Simple English Wikipedia serves as a simplified version of articles to make complex articles more accessible to the layperson on a given topic in Basic English. Wikipedia's popularity, mass readership, and free accessibility has led the encyclopedia to command a substantial second-hand cognitive authority across the world.},

When the Japanese verbalize 70 things, they are trying to get the other person to understand 100, for they are using implicit understandings and at times non-verbal cues to get their point across. Edward T. Hall, a cultural anthropologist, found that cultures can be separated into two groups with regard to communication. High context cultures (such as East Asian, Latin American, Southern Mediterranean and Arab countries) were commonly homogeneous, sharing a history of common values and assumptions. When people of high context cultures communicate, it is not necessary for them to say everything explicitly. Non-verbal cues often communicate what is not said, and silence can have great meaning! In parallel to this are low context cultures (such as America, Canada and Western European countries). These communicators prefer clear descriptions, unambiguous communication and are highly specific. Low context communicators do not rely on or trust our relationships in business communication. They rely on the spoken or written word. Deborah Rinner, Vice President, Tero International explains how we can bridge the communication gap between high-context communicators and low-context communicators.

  abstract = {This is a~print on demand~book and is therefore non- returnable. Christians today are besieged by ideas about personhood --- what it means to be a whole person, a happy person, a fulfilled person, a healthy person. In fact, Robert C. Roberts says, psychology has invaded the Christian church --- and while modern psychologies offer insights and practices that can be helpfully adapted for Christian use, they sometimes contradict and can even displace true Christianity. Roberts examines several psychologies that tend to function as alternative spiritualities --- Rogerian therapy, rational emotive therapy, assertiveness training, contextual family therapy, the psychology of Carl Jung, and the psychology of Hienz Kohut --- and offers a critical evaluation of each in light of the Christian view of the self. But just what is the Christian interpretation of selfhood? It has a great deal to do with community, with our relationships to others and to God, explains Roberts. "Christians are people of God's Word," Roberts says, "called daily to take it to heart, and thus be formed, as persons, by the sound of his voice. This book is all about becoming persons who dwell, in a variety of ways, among other persons." With this idea of personhood in mind, Roberts explores a variety of relationships important to the Christian personality, then sets forth the parameters of a distinctively Christian psychology. Based on impressive scholarship yet highly readable,~Taking the Word to Heart~is a thoughtful study that will be of interest to laypeople as well as pastors, Christian counselors, theologians, and students.},

There is conflicting evidence, however, on whether the engagement benefits of such applications outweigh their potential cost as a source of disaffection. To investigate these issues, this article presents a case study on the usage of a social media app (SpeakUp) during a semester-long face-to-face university course, and its relations with the context and the learning outcomes. In this mixed-methods study, we gathered data from multiple sources (video recordings of the lessons, SpeakUp logs and messages, student questionnaires, and course assessments) in order to extract self-reported and observable behavioral and emotional indicators. Our findings reveal that simple measures of behavioral engagement were insufficient to predict academic performance. Nevertheless, our models significantly improved using relatively simple and unobtrusive indicators of both behavioral and emotional engagement and disaffection. This article also indicates that the mere introduction of social media in educational settings does not guarantee a positive impact on learning. To promote an effective use of social media in the classroom (raising engagement while avoiding disaffection), teachers need to design the learning activities aligning the use of social media with the learning goals.},

  abstract = {Governments around the world, but especially in Europe, have increasingly used private sector involvement in developing, financing and providing public health infrastructure and service delivery through public--private partnerships (PPPs). Reasons for this uptake are manifold ranging from rising expenditures for refurbishing, maintaining and operating public assets, and increasing constraints on government budgets stifle, seeking innovation through private sector acumen and aiming for better risk management. Although PPPs have attracted practitioner and academic interest over the last two decades, there has been no attempt to integrate the general and health management literature to provide a holistic view of PPPs in healthcare delivery. This study analyzes over 1400 publications from a wide range of disciplines over a 20-year time period. We find that despite the scale and significance of the phenomenon, there is relatively limited conceptualization and in-depth empirical investigation. Based on bibliographic and content analyses, we synthesize formerly dispersed research perspectives into a comprehensive multi-dimensional framework of public-private partnerships. In so doing, we provide new directions for further research and practice.},

We propose that engagement with new possibilities -- seeing `doors opening' in the wake of loss -- is key in this process. We hypothesized that people would report greater growth if they saw new possibilities in the aftermath of adversity. We also predicted that unless people had engaged with new possibilities, they would report greater deterioration when adversity disrupted their core beliefs. A diverse group of adults (N = 276) from the US and India participated in a cross-sectional online study. Individuals experienced more growth if they had experienced more core belief disruption and more engagement with new possibilities. Engagement partially mediated the relationship between core belief disruption and growth. Engagement may also buffer against deterioration when core beliefs are disrupted. We conclude that pursuing new opportunities may be a crucial step in growth.},

With his trademark acuity, wit, and thoughtfulness, Rolheiser shows how identifying and embracing discipleship will lead to new heights of spiritual awareness and maturity.~ In this new book, Rolheiser takes us on a journey through the dark night of the senses and of the spirit.~ Here, we experience the full gamut of human life, pleasure and fervor, disillusionment and boredom.~ But, as Rolheiser explains, when we embrace the struggle and yearning to know God we can experience too a profound re-understanding to our daily lives. ~ ``What lies beyond the essentials, the basics?'' Rolheiser writes. ``Where do we go once some of the basic questions in our lives have been answered, or at least brought to enough peace that our focus can shift away from ourselves to others? Where do we go once the basic questions in our lives are no longer the restless questions of youthful insecurity and loneliness? Who am I? Who loves me? How will my life turn out? Where do we go once the basic question in life becomes: How can I give my life away more purely, and more meaningfully? How do I live beyond my own heartaches, headaches, and obsessions so as to help make other peoples' lives more meaningful? The intent of this book is to try to address exactly those questions: How can we live less self- centered, more mature lives? What constitutes deep maturity and how do we reach that place? And, not unimportantly, what constitutes a more adult, Christian discipleship? What constitutes a truly mature following of Jesus?'' ~ As the poet Rainer Maria Rilke suggests, ``Live the questions now.'' In Sacred Fire, Rolheiser's deeply affecting prose urges us on in pursuit of the most holy of all passions---a deep and lasting intimacy with God.},

She is a professor at the University of Oxford, holding the Chair of Jurisprudence. She is well known for her theory of "hard choices," where she argues that many choices are not determined by objective reasons but instead involve values that are incommensurable. Her Ted Talk on the subject is at 10 million views. The podcast discussion delves into the inadequacy of the traditional trichotomous framework---better, worse, or equal---in evaluating values and making decisions. Chang argues for recognizing 'hard choices' as situations where options are qualitatively different yet equally viable, introducing the concept of 'par'. This idea is applied to various scenarios, from career decisions to healthcare dilemmas, and even the design of AI systems. Chang highlights the importance of human agency in making commitments when faced with hard choices, offering a framework to help individuals become the authors of their own lives. Furthermore, Chang shares insights about her current projects aimed at rectifying fundamental misunderstandings about value in AI design, advocating for a more nuanced and human-aligned approach to machine learning. The episode also touches on the philosophical influences of Derek Parfit and explores concepts like effective altruism, transformative experiences, and the value of commitment in living a meaningful life.

Ethics provide standards for operations and define the goals and expectations of the museum professional as well as the museum institution. Indigenous ethics defy codification and are realized by lived experience informed by generational transmission of language and culture. Indigenous ethics are derived from worldview and epistemology. A foundational goal of Indigenous ethics is to become fully human, knowing one's relationship to land, family, village and self. Drawing on a career history of working tribal museums, this paper will demonstrate how Indigenous ethics are applied in a tribal museum context. By having an increased awareness of Indigenous ethics, mainstream museums can be better equipped to honor those ethical expressions when they work with tribal researchers, curators and collaborators.},

In recent decades hope has also received a lot of attention in the social sciences. While all branches of psychology and psychiatry can be said to have an interest in hope inasmuch as they work to overcome hopelessness, positive psychology has had the most explicit discussion of hope. In that discussion varying emphasis is placed on intellectual, emotional, and volitional components. In this paper ideas about hope in Christian theology and positive psychology will be placed in conversation. The dialogue is interesting, but not easy. Theology talks more about the nature of hope, while psychology offers more on how to foster it. Theology has both individual and communal theories of hope; psychology has looked mainly at individuals. Theology assumes the existence of God and the presence of grace in the world; positive psychology sticks to empirical evidence. The most promising connections between Christian theology and positive psychology on the topic of hope are found in what is said about virtues, the cognitive and imaginative awareness of hopes, and practices that foster hope. The most significant differences lie in their evaluation of hope that is not focused on goals, the place of hope within an overall understanding of the human person, and the relation of the natural to the supernatural.},

Reporting on the responses of persons from 12 countries and eight different occupations, this study finds that, in many instances, persons from the same cultures and occupations tended to respond to these negotiating elements in a similar fashion. Survey responses were also examined with respect to the respondents' gender. The studty would appear to support the proposition that culture, occupational background, and gender can influence negoating style.},

The answer each individual gives to that question depends largely on their previous experiences with medical care, and on their geographical background and personal philosophy. It is not as simple as it sounds. But the world is getting smaller, and it is imperative that we develop a shared understanding of what kind of healthcare system works best for society in general, and how to fund this effectively. In this talk, Tarik Sammour challenges the audience to think about these questions and engages them in a passionate debate, while putting his own personal spin on things as all good speakers do! Tarik Sammour is a surgeon at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and an Associate Professor at the University of Adelaide, specialising in advanced bowel cancer surgery, patient outcome centred research and robotics. Throughout his training, Tarik has been privileged to work in a wide variety of healthcare systems, from the smallest general hospital in rural New Zealand to one of the largest medical centres in the United States, giving him a unique first-hand insight into what works well for patients and what doesn't. One of the reasons he eventually chose to settle in Adelaide was because he saw the city's potential as a leader in healthcare delivery and innovation. With an ageing population and spiralling healthcare costs, he has some ideas to solve problems that are relevant to us all.

We argue that both overt and covert racism, more than a mere representation of tension and two solitudes is programmed in the powerful postmodern/postcolonial discourse of the culture of the "Other ". As practiced in the current teaching and learning environment, it seems that differential treatment, inequity, and negligence are perceived in the daily interactions between minority students and mainstream faculty, affecting overall evaluations, grading, tracking, and teaching styles. This analytical inquiry recommends that a critical mass of professors from visible minority and designated groups is needed to address these negative perceptions, leading to a wholesome academic environment.},

Exactly 500 workers from organizations from different industries, primarily located in Ecuador, participated in this study. The comparison of different models using Confirmatory Factor Analysis proved that when acquiescence is not controlled, evidence leads to the rejection of a one-dimensional---or essentially one-dimensional---structure (bifactor model), thus questioning the initial conceptualization of the construct. But when this response bias is controlled, both the one-dimensional model ({$\chi$}               2               = 429.608 [223],               p               {$<$} .001; CFI = .974; TLI = .982; RMSEA = .043; SRMR = .063) and the bifactor model ({$\chi$}               2               = 270.730 [205],               p               = .001; CFI = .992; TLI = .994; RMSEA = .026; SRMR = .047) show relevant improvement in terms of goodness of fit over the three-correlated-factors model ({$\chi$}               2               = 537.038 [132],               p               {$<$} .001; CFI = .950; TLI = .942; RMSEA = .079; SRMR = .070). However, the low reliability of the substantive factors of the bifactor model makes the one-dimensional model preferable in applied studies. Finally, the results show how mistakes could be made when concluding on the possible relationships between work performance and other relevant variables, in case acquiescence is not controlled.},

We review the literature on two such aspects and highlight that differences and conflicts in moral beliefs, as well as the confrontational nature of many morally courageous acts, call into question prosociality.

Many reviewers are not aware that this figure includes conditions which most clinicians do not recognize as intersex, such as Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, and late-onset adrenal hyperplasia. If the term intersex is to retain any meaning, the term should be restricted to those conditions in which chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female. Applying this more precise definition, the true prevalence of intersex is seen to be about 0.018\%, almost 100 times lower than Fausto-Sterling s estimate of 1.7\%.},

But learning these skills is like learning a new language: it takes time and practice to communicate effectively, and lack of practice can lead to the loss of one's ability to use this new language. Suitable for both beginning students and seasoned practitioners, Skills for Effective Counseling provides a biblically integrated approach to foundational counseling skills that trains the reader to use specific microskills. These skills include perceiving, attending, validating emotion and empathic connection. Chapters include textbook features such as sample session dialogues, role plays and a variety of both in-class and out-of-class exercises and reflection activities that will engage various learning styles. Strategically interwoven throughout the chapters are special topics related to: multicultural counseling biblical/theological applications current and seminal research related to microskills diagnostic and theoretical implications clinical tips for using skills in "real world" counseling settings the relevance of specific microskills to interpersonal relationships and broader ministry settings This textbook and the accompanying IVP Instructor Resources include all of the activities and assignments that an instructor might need to execute a graduate, undergraduate, or lay course in foundational counseling skills. Professors teaching within CACREP-accredited professional counseling programs will be able to connect specific material in the textbook to the latest CACREP Standards.

This paper aims at providing evidence that social processes affect individual learning with digital materials. Based on these theories and empirical results, a social-processes-augmented theory is suggested: the Cognitive-Affective-Social Theory of Learning in digital Environments (CASTLE). This CASTLE postulates that social cues in digital materials activate social schemata in learners leading to enhanced (para-)social, motivational, emotional, and metacognitive processes. To substantiate this theory, socio-cognitive theories are used, which predict social influences on learning with digital materials. Besides, previous empirical findings are presented assuming that with a rising number of social cues in digital materials, the influence of social processes increases. Finally, consequences regarding the design of digital learning media are discussed.},

We must address sensitive issues such as language, translation and cultural differences as well as local history, power and, possibly, colonial legacies. Our purpose in this paper is to explore the use of a Southern African philosophy, Ubuntu, as an appropriate ontology to guide qualitative nursing research, specifically constructivist grounded theory. To do so, we briefly discuss the historical problematic of Western research and its relationship to Africa and Africans. We introduce the principles of Ubuntu and its role in African society and use constructivist grounded theory as an example of a methodology that is congruent with Ubuntu. We highlight the areas of correspondence between them. The values of Ubuntu, of mutuality, interdependence, humility, solidarity and so forth could serve as a way to strengthen any research, by reminding researchers to enter the field with humility, awe and wonder at the complexity of human life.},

Because few physicians have been introduced to the large body of literature on leadership and organizations, we herein provide a concise review, as this literature relates to competitive health care organizations and the leaders who serve them. Although the US health care industry has transitioned to a dynamic market economy governed by a wide range of internal and external forces, health care organizations continue to be dominated by leaders who practice an outmoded transactional style of leadership and by organizational hierarchies that are inherently stagnant. In contrast, outside the health care sector, service industries have repeatedly demonstrated that transformational, situational, and servant leadership styles are most successful in energizing human resources within organizations. This optimization of intellectual capital is further enhanced by transforming organizations into adaptable learning organizations where traditional institutional hierarchies are flattened and efforts to evoke change are typically team driven and mission oriented.Arch Surg. 2002;137:1419-1427--{$>$}},

Also, because of his emphasis on the character of the moral agent, and on the importance of perception and emotion in moral decision-making, Aristotelian virtue theory provides a useful supplement to the traditional duty-based approaches to health care ethics analysis, which are increasingly being identified in the literature as having limits to their application within the health care context.},

An outstanding athlete with a stubborn and competitive spirit, he lost his leg to cancer at 19, but said ``nobody is ever going to call me a quitter.''On April 12, 1980, Terry Fox set out from St. John's, Newfoundland to begin the run across Canada that he named the Marathon of Hope. His ambition was to raise a million dollars for cancer research. It wasn't easy. Initial support from communities varied from terrific to nothing at all. His prosthetic leg was painful to run on, and there were always traffic and extreme weather conditions to deal with. But, by the time he reached Ontario -- a journey of more than 3,000 kilometres -- word of his achievement had spread, and thousands cheered him and followed his progress. Terry's spirits soared, and now he hoped to raise \$22 million dollars -- one dollar for every Canadian. He succeeded in this ambition, but the Marathon of Hope ended near Thunder Bay, Ontario on September 1, 1980. The cancer had spread to his lungs, and, after running 24 miles in one day, on the next he could run no further.When cancer finally claimed his life in 1981, Canada mourned the loss of a hero, but the Terry Fox Marathon of Hope lives on. The Terry Fox Foundation raised more than \$17 million in 1999, and support for the event nationally and around the world is growing.},

Drawing on lessons learnt from participatory action research with South African science teachers and on Ubuntu research literature, I develop, and reflect on, characteristics of an Ubuntu research ethics, agenda and methodology. Understood as humanness, Ubuntu encompasses a dimension of becoming human and being human. Both dimensions are realised through lived community and respectful, caring relations with other living beings and the environment. Thus, ethical protocols evolve around relating positively to others. Ubuntu research agendas contribute to strengthening community and methodologies are community based, relational and participatory. The emphasis of the article is not on presenting Ubuntu research as categorically oppositional to conventional methodologies, but on an approach to research that is grounded in indigenous African epistemologies.},

In the present report, when first-year law students (N = 46) relocated to attend law school, reducing conflict among curricular and extracurricular goals, optimism predicted larger delayed type hypersensitivity responses, indicating more robust in vivo cellular immunity. However, when students did not relocate, increasing goal conflict, optimism predicted smaller responses. Although this effect has been attributed to negative affect when difficult stressors violate optimistic expectancies, distress did not mediate optimism's effects on immunity. Alternative affective mediators related to engagement -- engaged affect and fatigue -- likewise failed to mediate optimism's effects, although all three types of affect independently influenced in vivo immunity. Alternative pathways include effort or self-regulatory depletion.},

Both experimental and naturalistic studies show that optimism is negatively related to measures of cellular immunity when stressors are difficult (e.g., complex, persistent, and uncontrollable) but positively related when stressors are easy (e.g., straightforward, brief, and controllable). Although the negative relationship between optimism and immunity has been attributed to the violation of optimists' positive expectancies and subsequent disappointment, empirical evidence suggests that it is more likely to be a consequence of optimists' greater engagement during difficult stressors. For example, negative mood does not account for the effect, but conscientiousness, a personality facet related to engagement, does. The mixed immunological correlates of optimism may explain why it does not consistently predict better disease outcomes.},

Finally, the authors focus on psychological interventions that increase individual happiness. In a 6-group, random-assignment, placebo-controlled Internet study, the authors tested 5 purported happiness interventions and 1 plausible control exercise. They found that 3 of the interventions lastingly increased happiness and decreased depressive symptoms.

Delivered on the Web, positive psychology exercises relieved depressive symptoms for at least 6 months compared with placebo interventions, the effects of which lasted less than a week. In severe depression, the effects of these Web exercises were particularly striking. This address reports two preliminary studies: In the first, PPT delivered to groups significantly decreased levels of mild-to-moderate depression through 1-year follow-up. In the second, PPT delivered to individuals produced higher remission rates than did treatment as usual and treatment as usual plus medication among outpatients with major depressive disorder. Together, these studies suggest that treatments for depression may usefully be supplemented by exercises that explicitly increase positive emotion, engagement, and meaning.

  abstract = {Learning with online video is pervasive in higher education. Recent research has explored the importance of student engagement when learning with video in online and blended courses. However, little is known about students' goals and intents when engaging with video. Furthermore, there is limited empirical evidence on the impact of learning context on engagement with video, which limits our understanding of how students learn from video. To address this gap, we identify a set of engagement goals for learning with video, and study associated student activity in relation to learning context (course week, exam, and rewatch). In Study 1, we conducted a survey (n~=~116) that maps students' video viewing activities to their engagement goals and intents. We identified a variety of engagement goals, specifically Reflect, Flag, Remember, Clarify, Skim, Search, Orient, and Take a break. In Study 2, we analyzed clickstream data generated by 387 students enrolled in three semester-long courses. We examined the impact of learning context on students' engagement with video. A multilevel model showed different patterns for online and blended courses. Students in the online course showed much more strategic and adaptive use of video. As the semester progressed, students in the online courses performed fewer Reflect and Search. During exam weeks and when rewatching videos, online students performed more Search within the video. The only trend that was found for blended learning students was an increase in Skim with course week. These findings have implications for video players that adapt to context, such as helping students easily locate important in-video information during the exam week or when rewatching previously watched videos.},

Results indicate that the survey items cohere into interpretable factors that represent the intended constructs. Further it was determined through structural equation modeling that 70\% of the variance in the online students' levels of cognitive presence, a multivariate measure of learning, can be modeled based on their reports of their instructors' skills in fostering teaching presence and their own abilities to establish a sense of social presence. Additional analysis identifies more details of the relationship between learner understandings of teaching and social presence and its impact on their cognitive presence. Implications for online teaching, policy, and faculty development are discussed.},

However, the effect of the relationship between an employee and a comparison other on such judgments has received scant attention. We tested this effect across three studies involving demographically (employees, students) and culturally (U.S., India) different samples and research designs (critical incident and scenario). Our results broadly suggest that, with inputs held constant, receiving a lower outcome than a comparison other is judged as fairer (and more satisfactory) when positively (vs. negatively) tied to the other. In contrast, a favorable outcome is judged as fairer when the comparison other is negatively (vs. positively) related. We also found that the impact of (in)equity on employees' discrete emotions (i.e., guilt, happiness, anger) differed based on their relational tie with comparison others, and that differences in anger and happiness mediated the effects of (in)equity on outcome satisfaction.},

Examining the key traditions of hermeneutic, genealogy, and critical theory, and the texts of major thinkers such as Gadamer, Ricoeur, Derrida, Nietzsche, Foucault, the Early Frankfurt School and Habermas, she also contextualizes contemporary developments within strands of thought stemming back to Ancient Greece and Rome. Sherratt shows how these modes of thinking developed through medieval Christian thought into the Enlightenment and Romantic eras, before becoming mainstays of twentieth-century disciplines. Continental Philosophy of Social Science will serve as the essential textbook for courses in philosophy or social sciences.},

Building on their definition, the authors then present a framework of inclusion. Their framework is subsequently used as a basis for reviewing the inclusion and diversity literature.

According to researchers, formative feedback should be nonevaluative, supportive, timely, and specific. Formative feedback is usually presented as information to a learner in response to some action on the learner's part. It comes in a variety of types (e.g., verification of response accuracy, explanation of the correct answer, hints, worked examples) and can be administered at various times during the learning process (e.g., immediately following an answer, after some time has elapsed). Finally, several variables have been shown to interact with formative feedback's success at promoting learning (e.g., individual characteristics of the learner and aspects of the task). All of these issues are discussed. This review concludes with guidelines for generating formative feedback. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.},

Based on a recent theoretical framework that postulates predominantly different bases for group behaviors in Western cultures versus Eastern cultures, it was predicted that Americans would tend to trust people primarily based on whether they shared category memberships; however, trust for Japanese was expected to be based on the likelihood of sharing direct or indirect interpersonal links. Results supported these predictions. In both Study 1 (questionnaire study) and Study 2 (online money allocation game), Americans trusted ingroup members more than outgroup members; however, the existence of a potential indirect relationship link increased trust for outgroup members more for Japanese than for Americans.

  abstract = {Critical thinking is currently much celebrated in the contemporary West and beyond, not least in higher education. Tertiary education students are generally expected to adopt a critical attitude in order to become responsible and constructive participants in the development of modern democratic society. Currently, the perceived desirability of critical thinking has even made it into a seemingly successful marketable commodity. A brief online search yields a vast number of books that are mostly presented as self-help manuals to enable readers to enhance their critical abilities. But how should critical thinking be taught? Is it at all possible? Instead of attempting to provide a direct answer to this pressing question, this paper seeks inspiration in a culturally rather remote philosophy of education that hitherto has not been regarded as a stimulant for critical thinking, namely the ancient philosophy of Confucianism. The paper argues that not only are most if not all types of thinking regarded in the West as `critical' also present in Confucianism, but also that the Confucian philosophy presides over a particular type which increasingly tends to be neglected in the contemporary West; a type that I call `transformative self-critical attitude'. Through a comparison with the well-known Teaching Perspectives Inventory in higher education, the transformative self-critical attitude is used to elucidate some further aspects of the Confucian philosophy of education that may offer valuable insights to contemporary educators.},

Since then, millions have been touched by the power of his ideas, including more than 28 million who've watched his TED Talk based on START WITH WHY -- the third most popular TED video of all time. ~ Sinek starts with a fundamental question: Why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over?  ~ People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers had little in common, but they all started with WHY. They realized that people won't truly buy into a product, service, movement, or idea until they understand the WHY behind it.~  ~ START WITH WHY shows that the leaders who've had the greatest influence in the world all think, act, and communicate the same way -- and it's the opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be led, and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY.},

But what he's doing is so simple, it's almost instructional. This is key. You must be easy to follow! Now comes the first follower with a crucial role: he publicly shows everyone how to follow. Notice the leader embraces him as an equal, so it's not about the leader anymore - it's about them, plural. Notice he's calling to his friends to join in. It takes guts to be a first follower! You stand out and brave ridicule, yourself. Being a first follower is an under-appreciated form of leadership. The first follower transforms a lone nut into a leader. If the leader is the flint, the first follower is the spark that makes the fire. The 2nd follower is a turning point: it's proof the first has done well. Now it's not a lone nut, and it's not two nuts. Three is a crowd and a crowd is news. A movement must be public. Make sure outsiders see more than just the leader. Everyone needs to see the followers, because new followers emulate followers - not the leader. Now here come 2 more, then 3 more. Now we've got momentum. This is the tipping point! Now we've got a movement! As more people jump in, it's no longer risky. If they were on the fence before, there's no reason not to join now. They won't be ridiculed, they won't stand out, and they will be part of the in-crowd, if they hurry. Over the next minute you'll see the rest who prefer to be part of the crowd, because eventually they'd be ridiculed for not joining. And ladies and gentlemen that is how a movement is made! Let's recap what we learned: If you are a version of the shirtless dancing guy, all alone, remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals, making everything clearly about the movement, not you. Be public. Be easy to follow! But the biggest lesson here - did you catch it? Leadership is over-glorified. Yes it started with the shirtless guy, and he'll get all the credit, but you saw what really happened: It was the first follower that transformed a lone nut into a leader. There is no movement without the first follower. We're told we all need to be leaders, but that would be really ineffective. The best way to make a movement, if you really care, is to courageously follow and show others how to follow. When you find a lone nut doing something great, have the guts to be the first person to stand up and join in. --- Original video at ~~~{$\bullet~$}Sasquatch~music~festival~2009~-~Guy~starts...}

We then observed that superior performance at the firm or SBU level was achieved when specific marketing strategy types were matched with appropriate Miles and Snow (1978) business strategy types.

Higher hope consistently is related to better outcomes in academics, athletics, physical health, psychological adjustment, and psychotherapy. Processes that lessen hope in children and adults are reviewed. Using the hope theory definition, no evidence is found for "false" hope. Future research is encouraged in regard to accurately enhancing hope in medical feedback and helping people to pursue those goals for which they are best suited.}

  abstract = {Defining hope as a cognitive set that is composed of a reciprocally derived sense of successful (1) agency (goal-directed determination) and (2) pathways (planning of ways to meet goals), an individual-differences measure is developed. Studies with college students and patients demonstrate acceptable internal consistency and test--retest reliability, and the factor structure identifies the agency and pathways components of the Hope Scale. Convergent and discriminant validity are documented, along with evidence suggesting that Hope Scale scores augmented the prediction of goal-related activities and coping strategies beyond other self-report measures. Construct validational support is provided in regard to predicted goal-setting behaviors; moreover, the hypothesized goal appraisal processes that accompany the various levels of hope are corroborated.

  abstract = {"I believe that [Bob Greenleaf's] essay, 'The Servant as Leader' is the most singular and useful statement on leadership that I have read in the last 20 years. Despite a virtual tidal wave of books on leadership during the last few years, there is something different about Bob Greenleaf's essay, something both simpler and more profound . . . For many years, I simply told people not to waste their time reading all the other managerial leadership books. 'If you are really serious about the deeper territory of true leadership,' I would say, 'read Greenleaf.' " {\texthorizontalbar}from Chapter 20 by Peter M. Senge, Director of the Center for Organizational Learning at MIT's Sloan School of Management and author of The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization "There is a building momentum for enlightened leadership in the for-profit world, the social sector, and many areas of government today . . . Good books that deal with the beliefs and convictions that nurture this movement are not easy to find. This is one. Reflections on Leadership is a worthy and worthwhile gift to all those who attach high value both to their responsibilities and to the people with whom they work." {\texthorizontalbar}from the Foreword, by Max DePree, Chairman and CEO of Herman Miller Inc. and author of Leadership Is an Art and Leadership Jazz "I could give you three examples of major businesses who have used this business of servant-leadership training . . . at times of terrible crisis and have worked themselves out of the crisis. Practicing servant-leadership . . . had absolutely enormous incredible benefits for them . . . and then they threw it away. Because, as soon as the crisis passed, they said 'why exert ourselves?' The great problem is not how to . . . teach servant-leadership in the first place, but to get organizations to continue to use it and embed it in part of their culture." {\texthorizontalbar}from Chapter 7 by M. Scott Peck, author of The Road Less Traveled"Reflections on Leadership is fitting tribute to a man whose own sense of service has given all of us hope that at long last leaders will recognize that power of purpose is far stronger than power of position. After nearly 30 years, Robert K. Greenleaf's work has struck a resonant chord in the minds and hearts of scholars and practitioners alike. His message lives through others, the true legacy of a servant-leader." {\texthorizontalbar}Jim Kouzes, Chairman and CEO of TPG/Learning Systems and coauthor of The Leadership Challenge and Credibility"We are each indebted to Greenleaf for bringing spirit and values into the workplace. His ideas will have enduring value for every generation of leaders." {\texthorizontalbar}Peter Block, Founding Partner, Designed Learning Inc. and author of The Empowered Manager, Flawless Consulting, and Stewardship: Choosing Service Over Self-InterestIn the twenty-five years since Robert K. Greenleaf first articulated his vision of "servant-leadership," the world has seen a steady expansion in the influence of the man and his ideas. Hailed as the "grandfather" of the modern empowerment movement in business leadership, Greenleaf described true leaders as those who lead by serving others {\texthorizontalbar}empowering them to reach their full potential. He saw the ideal leader as one who transforms and integrates an organization; a steward with a commitment to the growth of people and the building of a community.Reflections on Leadership demonstrates the scope of Greenleaf's impact on contemporary management theory and offers key essays by Greenleaf and his leading business and intellectual disciples. They include such influential thinkers as M. Scott Peck, author of The Road Less Traveled, and Peter Senge, author of The Fifth Discipline."Despite all the buzz about modern leadership techniques, no one knows better than Greenleaf what really matters." {\texthorizontalbar}Working Woman magazineReflections on Leadership opens with two remarkable essays by Greenleaf himself. One of them, "Reflections from Experience," published here for the first time, presents Greenleaf's prophetic observations on the use of executive power in an organization. In "Life's Choices and Markers," Greenleaf recounts five significant influences that led him to develop his revolutionary ideas on the nature of leadership."Servant-leadership deals with the reality of power in everyday life{\texthorizontalbar}its legitimacy, the ethical restraints upon it and the beneficial results that can be attained through the appropriate use of power." {\texthorizontalbar}The New York TimesIn Reflections on Leadership, a host of notable management thinkers explore the implications of the servant-leadership concept in such areas as:Business ethicsTeam-building and servant-leadershipCorporate risk-takingSpirit in the workplaceBecoming a servant-leaderThe future of leadershipFor those who have already benefited from Greenleaf's ideas and wish to deepen their understanding, this is an essential book. It is also the ideal introduction for those eager to draw on a source of wisdom that has inspired so many others.},

It argues that there are five stages of human needs that motivate our behavior. \#learn \#motivation Never miss a new video :  http://eepurl.com/dNU4BQ  Join and support us! www.patreon.com/sprouts  www.sproutsschools.com  Script: Abraham Maslow proposed his theory in 1943 after studying what he called exemplary people such as Albert Einstein or Eleanor Roosevelt. STAGE 1 First, there are physiological needs, such as the need to breathe, eat, drink or sleep. The moment we got enough of that and we feel awake and our bellies are full, we get motivated by the next thing. STAGE 2 Now we want safety. We try to earn money, build up resources and look for shelter that protects us against dangers. Once we are satisfied and feel safe, we have time to think about what we want next. STAGE 3 At stage three we seek love and belonging. We desire to be close to family and friends, belong to a society or join a gang. But the moment we feel completely part of a group we already wish to be a little different than the rest. At stage four we look for esteem, self-confidence, and respect from our peers. We want to be someone. If we have money, we buy a fancy watch. If we have a brain, we write or think or work a lot. Motivation to perform and compete is now at its highest. Students, sportsmen, and inventors excel. Neil Armstrong even flew to the moon. STAGE 5 Only if we breathe and drink and eat and sleep enough and we feel safe and part of a group and still special, only then we can reach level five: self-actualization. Now we can relax, be creative, accept facts for what they are, give back or do whatever we want. No more pressure, unless of course there is trouble below. If you are a leader and believe in the theory, use it. First, make sure everyone has eaten well. Then make them feel safe and help them belong to a group. Once they feel they belong, they are ready to stand out and excel.}

It has a long and storied history in family science.

They found that living together before marriage was associated with lower odds of divorce in the first year of marriage, but increased odds of divorce in all other years tested, and this finding held across decades of data.},

We also examined whether eudaimonic behaviors were more strongly related to well-being than behaviors directed toward obtaining pleasure or material goods. In both studies, eudaimonic behaviors had consistently stronger relations to well-being than hedonic behaviors. Data also provided support for a temporal sequence in which eudaimonic behaviors were related to greater well-being the next day. Overall, our results suggest that "doing good" may be an important avenue by which people create meaningful and satisfying lives. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Social support was a significant predictor of all mental health outcomes, particularly life satisfaction. Although classmate and teacher support were significant unique predictors of students' internalizing and externalizing symptoms, respectively, parent support emerged as the strongest predictor of all indicators of mental health. Academic achievement moderated the direction and strength of the relationships between externalizing behavior and (a) classmate support, and (b) parent support, respectively. Specifically, classmate support emerged as adaptive for average- and high-achieving students only, whereas academic achievement functioned as a protective factor against the manifestation of externalizing psychopathology among students with low parental support. Implications for school psychologists and directions for future research are discussed. (Contains 3 tables and 2 figures.)},

  abstract = {This article examines transformational leadership and servant leadership to determine what similarities and differences exist between the two leadership concepts. The authors posit that the primary difference between transformational leadership and servant leadership is the focus of the leader. The transformational leader's focus is directed toward the organization, and his or her behavior builds follower commitment toward organizational objectives, while the servant leader's focus is on the followers, and the achievement of organizational objectives is a subordinate outcome. The extent to which the leader is able to shift the primary focus of leadership from the organization to the follower is the distinguishing factor in classifying leaders as either transformational or servant leaders. This article also looks at the next stage of developmental issues in servant leadership, such as the challenges facing empirical investigation and measurement, and the changes that are occurring in current thinking about the servant leadership approach. Ultimately, the case is made that although different, both transformational leadership and servant leadership offer the conceptual framework for dynamic leadership.},

Let's start with a scenario: Mathematically, the SD of the sampling distribution is equal to the SD ({$\sigma$}) of the population divided by the sample size. This is because as the sample size increases, sample means cluster more closely around the population mean. Why standard error is important: It tells us how confident we should be when representing the average of a whole population ({$\mu$}) based on data gathered from sample means.}

The World Health Organization had a ready-made solution, which was to spray copious amounts of DDT around the island. With the application of DDT, the mosquitoes that carried the malaria were knocked down, and so was the malaria.  There were some interesting side effects, though.  The first was that the roofs of people's houses began to collapse on their heads (sound 50-52).  It seems the DDT not only killed off the malaria-carrying mosquitoes, but it also killed a species of parasitic wasp that up to that point had controlled a population of thatch-eating caterpillars.  Without the wasps, the caterpillars multiplied and flourished, and began munching their way through the villagers' roofs. That was just the beginning. The DDT affected a lot of the island's other insects, which were eaten by the resident population of small lizards called geckos. The biological half-life of DDT is around 8 years, so animals like geckos do not metabolize it very fast, and it stays in their system for a long time. Over time, the geckos began to accumulate pretty high loads of DDT, and while they tolerated the DDT fairly well, the island's resident cats, which dined on the geckos, did not.  The cats ate the geckos and the DDT contained in the geckos killed the cats. With the cats gone, the island's population of rats came out to play and we all know what happens when rats multiply and flourish.  Pretty soon the Dayak people were back on the phone to the World Health Organization, only this time it wasn't malaria they were complaining about. It was plague and the destruction of their grain stores caused by the overpopulation of rats. This time, though, the World Health Organization didn't have a ready-made solution and had to invent one: they decided to parachute live cats into Borneo.  ``Operation Cat Drop'' occurred courtesy of the Royal Air Force and eventually stabilized the situation. Conclusion: If you don't understand the inter-relatedness of things, solutions often cause more problems Simple questions often require complex and reflective thinking if good solutions are to be found It is always better to manage by design than by default}

Ethnographic methods of in-depth interviews (n\,=\,25), observations of home visits (n\,=\,9), and review of documents (n\,=\,12) were employed to expose gender (in)equities.FindingsThis critical analysis sheds light on institutional discourses that reproduce gender inequities: discourses of difference and denial; discourses of individuality, autonomy, and choice; and discourses of efficiency, objectivity, and rationality. Although gender was discounted, these neoliberal discourses reinforced traditional gender relations.DiscussionNeoliberal discourses frame health and health-care experiences as resulting primarily from individual behaviors and biomedical factors, permitting health-care providers and policy makers to overlook power relations and the sociopolitical forces that obscure gender inequities. A critical perspective is needed to consider how social structures significantly shape everyday gendered experiences in hospice palliative home care.},

The Analytical Marketer provides critical insight into the changing marketing organizationdigital, agile, and analyticaland the tools for reinventing it.Written by the head of global marketing for SAS, The Analytical Marketer is based on the author's firsthand experience of transforming a marketing organization from art'' to art and science.'' Challenged and inspired by their company's own analytics products, the SAS marketing team was forced to rethink itself in order to take advantage of the new capabilities that those tools offer the modern marketer. Key marketers and managers at SAS tell their stories alongside the author's candid lessons learned as she led the marketing organization's transformation. With additional examples from other leading companies, this book is a practical guide and set of best practices for creating a new marketing culture that thrives on and adds value through data and analytics.},

Without this understanding, we enter the future in a state of informed bewilderment. Every day we are bombarded by reports about ecosystem breakdown, social conflict, economic stagnation and a crisis of identity. There is mounting evidence that deeper transitions are underway that suggest we may be entering another period of great transformation equal in significance to the agricultural revolution some 13,000 years ago or the Industrial Revolution 250 years ago. This book helps readers make sense of our global crisis and the dynamics of transition that could result in a shift from the industrial epoch that we live in now to a more sustainable and equitable age. The global renewable energy transition that is already underway holds the key to the wider just transition. However, the evolutionary potential of the present also manifests in the mushrooming of ecocultures, new urban visions, sustainability-oriented developmental states and new ways of learning and researching. Shedding light on the highly complex challenge of a sustainable and just transition, this book is essential reading for anyone concerned with establishing a more sustainable and equitable world. Ultimately, this is a book about hope but without easy answers.},

Behavioral design offers a new solution. By de-biasing organizations instead of individuals, we can make smart changes that have big impacts.

  abstract = {Although research has identified dozens of behavioral and psychosocial strategies for boosting resilience in adults, little is known about the common underlying pathways. A comprehensive review of these strategies using an affective neuroscience approach indicates three distinct general routes to resilience: 1) down-regulating the negative (e.g., exposure, cognitive reappraisal) by reducing distress-related responses of the amygdala, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and autonomic nervous system; 2) up-regulating the positive (e.g., optimism, social connectedness) by activating mesostriatal reward pathways, which in turn can buffer the effects of stress; and 3) transcending the self (e.g., mindfulness, religious engagement) by reducing activation in the default mode network, a network associated with self-reflection, mind-wandering, and rumination. Some strategies (e.g., social support) can boost resilience via more than one pathway. Under- or over-stimulation of a pathway can result in vulnerability, such as over-stimulation of the reward pathway through substance abuse. This tripartite model of resilience-building is testable, accounts for a large body of data on adult resilience, and makes new predictions with implications for practice.},

Schein talked about his latest project on Humble Leadership. Edgar Schein investigates organizational culture, process consultation, research process, career dynamics, and organization learning and change. He analyzes how consultants work on problems in human systems and the dynamics of the helping process, and defines Humble Inquiry as ``the fine art of drawing someone out, of asking questions to which you do not know the answer, of building a relationship based on curiosity and interest in the other person.'' In this seminal work, Schein contrasts Humble Inquiry with other kinds of inquiry, shows the benefits Humble Inquiry provides in many different settings, and offers advice on overcoming the cultural, organizational, and psychological barriers that keep us from practicing it. Schein has written two cultural case studies ---``Strategic Pragmatism: The Culture of Singapore's Economic Development Board'' and ``DEC is Dead; Long Live DEC." and his Corporate Culture Survival Guide tells managers how to deal with culture issues in their organizations. He shows how individuals can diagnose their own career needs and how managers can diagnose the future of jobs. His research on culture shows how national, organizational, and occupational cultures influence organizational performance.

Arianna Huffington's personal wake-up call came in the form of a broken cheekbone and a nasty gash over her eye -- the result of a fall brought on by exhaustion and lack of sleep. As the cofounder and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post Media Group -- one of the fastest growing media companies in the world -- celebrated as one of the world's most influential women, and gracing the covers of magazines, she was, by any traditional measure, extraordinarily successful. Yet as she found herself going from brain MRI to CAT scan to echocardiogram, to find out if there was any underlying medical problem beyond exhaustion, she wondered is this really what success feels like? As more and more people are coming to realize, there is far more to living a truly successful life than just earning a bigger salary and capturing a corner office. Our relentless pursuit of the two traditional metrics of success -- money and power -- has led to an epidemic of burnout and stress-related illnesses, and an erosion in the quality of our relationships, family life, and, ironically, our careers. In being connected to the world 24/7, we're losing our connection to what truly matters. Our current definition of success is, as Thrive shows, literally killing us. We need a new way forward.

Canadian colleges have a large equity-seeking student population due to their open admission structure, but despite this, there are implicit biases and actions that impede students' learning experience. Limited literature exists around how Canadian colleges have approached EDI policy development; thus, this paper initiates the unpacking of the evident policy -- practice disconnect by asking: `How do colleges understand equity, diversity, and inclusion as articulated in policy documents?' To address this, the study employs Critical Policy Analysis (CPA) as its main research method to deconstruct the narratives found within purposefully sampled documents including: 1) EDI policies and procedure; 2) institutional multi-year strategic plans; and 3) EDI-based plans and performance reports. Results indicate that colleges tend to be selective in their usage of EDI definitions. There is also a tendency to use ambiguous language around EDI, which makes it difficult to mobilise knowledge effectively and approach equity directly. Policies often fail to address the privileges held by certain positionalities, reinforcing existing power structures rather than challenging them. The significance of this research is in its contribution to enhancing a theoretical understanding of how knowledge supports policy, as well as informing the future development of constructive EDI policies in higher educational institutions.},

Factors such as age, computer/internet self-efficacy, self-directed learning, learner control, and facilitation are all elements that influence students' intention to continue with online learning. Moreover, among the five subscales of readiness, motivation has the strongest connection with continuance intention. In addition, course facilitation was positively and significantly related to the intention to continue participating in courses.

The BC curriculum was designed with a simple principle in mind: to provide a balanced and comprehensive education to all students.  This was a time when education was becoming more accessible and the need for a standardised curriculum was becoming apparent. Over the years the curriculum evolved, incorporating new teaching methods and educational philosophies, always keeping up with the times.  By the mid 20th century the BC curriculum had established a reputation for providing a strong foundation in core subjects like Math, Science, English, and Social Studies.  Fast forward to the present day and the BC curriculum has only continued to adapt and grow. It now embraces a holistic approach to education focusing not only on academic knowledge but also on the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. It encourages students to be curious to ask questions and to develop a lifelong love for learning. The BC curriculum covers a wide range of subjects from the foundational ones like English, Math and Science to more specialized ones like Languages, Arts, Physical Education, and Technology. It is designed in a way that allows students to explore their interests and talents all the while ensuring they acquire essential skills and knowledge. The BC curriculum also places a strong emphasis on social responsibility and Global awareness.  Students learn about different cultures, histories and perspectives fostering empathy, open-mindedness and respect for diversity. The BC curriculum is recognized worldwide for its high standards and comprehensive approach to education. Universities around the globe acknowledge the BC diploma appreciating the well-rounded, knowledgeable and thoughtful individuals it produces.  The BC curriculum prepares students for University by equipping them with the necessary academic skills but it goes beyond that. It nurtures critical thinkers, problem solvers, and lifelong learners - qualities that are highly valued in higher education and the workplace. The BC curriculum has a rich history, a comprehensive and holistic content, and offers immense value to its students. It's not just about acquiring knowledge, it's about developing skills, nurturing curiosity, and fostering a love for learning. Whether it's preparing for University or life beyond that students who go through the BC curriculum are well equipped to face whatever comes their way.  So the next time you find yourself contemplating the importance of quality education remember the BC curriculum. It's a testament to the fact that a good education is not just about learning facts - it's about developing a well-rounded personality equipped with the skills and knowledge to navigate the world effectively and empathetically. Keep asking questions, keep learning, and remember - education is not just a journey: it's an adventure.}

  abstract = {\#education  Scaffolding in the Education System Scaffolding is a teaching strategy used in the elementary education system to support students as they learn new concepts and skills. It involves providing temporary support and guidance to help students reach higher levels of understanding and independence. Examples of Scaffolding in Education: 1. Breaking Down Tasks: Teachers may break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps to help students grasp the overall concept. For example, when learning to write a paragraph, students may start with brainstorming ideas, then move on to organizing those ideas into sentences, and finally, combine the sentences to create a coherent paragraph. 2. Providing Prompts: Teachers may provide prompts or cues to help students think through a problem or answer a question. For example, when solving a math word problem, a teacher may ask guiding questions to help students identify the relevant information and choose the appropriate operation. 3. Modeling: Teachers may demonstrate a skill or concept to students before expecting them to do it on their own. For instance, when teaching a science experiment, a teacher may perform the experiment in front of the class, explaining each step and the underlying scientific principles. 4. Offering Graphic Organizers: Graphic organizers, such as concept maps or Venn diagrams, can help students visually organize their thoughts and make connections between different ideas. These tools provide a framework for students to structure their thinking and enhance their understanding of a topic. 5. Peer Collaboration: Encouraging students to work together in pairs or small groups can promote scaffolding. Students can support and learn from each other as they tackle a task or solve a problem. This collaborative approach fosters communication, critical thinking, and mutual support. Scaffolding plays a crucial role in helping students develop their skills, build confidence, and eventually become independent learners.

Authenticity requires self-awareness and the ability to act in accordance with one's true self. Authentic leadership is an approach to leadership that represents one of the newest areas of leadership research and still in the formative stage of development. It focuses on whether leadership is genuine and ``real.'' Authentic leadership is about the authenticity of leaders and their leadership. Nowadays people demand trustworthy bona fide leaders who are honest and good. The leadership approach emphasizes building the leader's legitimacy through honest relationships with followers which value their input and are built on an ethical foundation.

  abstract = {This article describes the concept of posttraumatic growth, its conceptual foundations, and supporting empirical evidence. Posttraumatic growth is the experience of positive change that occurs as a result of the struggle with highly challenging life crises. It is manifested in a variety of ways, including an increased appreciation for life in general, more meaningful interpersonal relationships, an increased sense of personal strength, changed priorities, and a richer existential and spiritual life. Although the term is new, the idea that great good can come from great suffering is ancient. We propose a model for understanding the process of posttraumatic growth in which individual characteristics, support and disclosure, and more centrally, significant cognitive processing involving cognitive structures threatened or nullified by the traumatic events, play an important role. It is also suggested that posttraumatic growth mutually interacts with life wisdom and the development of the life narrative, and that it is an ongoing process, not a static outcome.}

For many years he lived a double life: respected political advisor by day, ``Party Peder'' by night. When his guilt and regret finally pulled him into a deep hole of despair, he embarked on a ``forgiveness road trip'' - to take responsibility for his actions, one small act at a time. We are what we do, not what we say. And in this talk, Peder shares the tools he discovered to truly own our screw-ups when relationships are on the line. Peder Tellefsdal believes that what we do in small, we do in large.  For 12 years he worked as a political advisor, shaping reforms and advising politicians on media and public debates. Today he's a Senior Communications Advisor and partner at Innoventi. In both fields he discovered the power of trust - not just building it, but practicing it in the small, daily moments.  On the stage at TEDxArendal, Peder will explore another ``small'' practice: the power of asking for forgiveness.

  abstract = {Sure pizza and doughnuts at work are a nice treat, and employees won't turn down a free holiday turkey, but is this actually helping employees feel recognized and engaged at work? Claire McCarty, a professor in the College of Business and Economics at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls, has spent over 25 years bridging the gap between management theory and practice.  It's been estimated that up to 70\% of U.S. workers are emotionally disconnected from their workplaces. The lack of recognition is certainly one reason. In an era of limited time, money, and energy, we need to focus on what actually works.

Through Shawn's heart felt experience and research he has found kernals of truth that define mentorship and displays the application of his findings. From this engaging talk and diagrams you will walk away with the what, why, when, and how the Science of Mentorship works. Mentorship specialist, author, speaker and mathematician, Shawn started his life as a crack baby. Growing up his main motivations were sex, money, cars, girls, and clothes. His mentors were his two older brothers --- one murdered in a drug transaction --- the other serving life in a Federal Prison for allegedly being one of Detroit's most notorious drug lords. After losing his brothers to violence and prison, Shawn found another path that lead him to an education and opportunity. Fast forward and Blanchard was appointed to the city of Detroit's Mayoral Cabinet as the Director of Youth Services. Throughout his tenure he successfully launched a citywide elementary soccer league and provided nearly 5,600 jobs, heading the Grow Detroit's Young Talent youth employment initiative.

To be honest, he made me angry,'' Guido says. ``He was explaining how difficult politics are, talking about the dilemmas he faces every day. But he did not present solutions. Not one. And not even a plan to get one.'' In his anger Guido, a designer with many years of experience, suddenly understood he had an entirely different way of thinking. Designers always explore new ideas. Problems are challenges for their creativity. His anger became wonder. ``I asked myself what makes design thinking so different. And above all what it might contribute to teams and companies. And even politics.'' Together with the Technical University Delft he made movies of product development teams in the wild, and analyzed these with 7 researchers. They discovered how ideas arise in teams, captured the origins of innovation and revealed what designers contribute.''

Inherent in this challenge is clearly defining educational and training outcomes consistent with this imperative. The traditional notion of competence in clinical training as a detached mastery of a theoretically finite body of knowledge may not be appropriate for this area of physician education. Cultural humility is proposed as a more suitable goal in multicultural medical education. Cultural humility incorporates a lifelong commitment to self-evaluation and self-critique, to redressing the power imbalances in the patient-physician dynamic, and to developing mutually beneficial and nonpaternalistic clinical and advocacy partnerships with communities on behalf of individuals and defined populations.}

  abstract = {In this lecture, Dr. Tom Rudel overviews three classical sociological theorists -- Marx, Weber and Durkheim.  He notes that all three are structuralists, but that each identifies a different force that structures economic activity and outcomes. He describes Marx's focus on the factory as the site of consumption and production, and he notes the contemporary theories of the treadmill of production and world systems as deriving from Marx's theories. He then summarizes the theories of Weber, who sees the rationalized state as structuring production and consumption, and he highlights ecological modernization and notions of a world society as updates of Weber's theories. Finally, he discusses Durkheim's ideas about occupations and the division of labor as structuring economic activity, and notes the theoretical assumption that stability and technological developments are generated by economic specialization.

From the persecutions in the Roman Empire to the establishment of key doctrines and councils, the Church evolved into the global faith we know today. 📖 In this video, we explore: ✅ The birth of the Church: Jesus, the Apostles, and Pentecost ✅ How early Christians spread the faith despite persecution ✅ The role of Church Councils in shaping doctrine ✅ The influence of the Roman Empire on Church growth ✅ How the early Church set the foundation for modern Christianity How was the Early Church founded? What are the origins of the Early Church? In this video, we'll provide an overview of the Church's inception. We'll discuss when the Church was founded, where the Church was founded, and how the Church was founded. Excerpt:  The Church was born on the day of Pentecost, a Jewish feast marking the ingathering of the harvest into barns. Pentecost marked the beginning of the Church's sharing her faith which was harvested throughout the time Jesus walked on earth with everyone in the world.},

This is a beautiful and high truth that reaches its pinnacle in the cross. There God Himself takes the whole weight of our sins upon His human shoulders and bears them through terrible suffering, even unto death. He does this precisely so that his redeeming mercy and love for us sinners would shine out more clearly.  Want to learn more?

On the basis of an appreciation of the serious difficulties inherent in certain philosophical and theoretical positions currently evident within nursing's literature, the authors argue for a less extreme and more integrated reference point for nursing's theory and practice.},

  abstract = {In 1978, Barbara Carper named personal knowing as a fundamental way of knowing in our discipline. By that, she meant the discovery of self-and-other, arrived at through reflection, synthesis of perceptions and connecting with what is known. Along with empirics, aesthetics and ethics, personal knowing was understood as an essential attribute of nursing knowledge evolution, setting the context for the nurse to become receptively attentive to and engaged within the interpersonal processes of practice. Although much has been done over the 40 years since Carper described these ways of knowing, and we have seen enormous advances in empirics and ethics, and I would argue even in aesthetics (understanding the subtle craft of nursing in action), personal knowing may not have attracted its fair share of critical unpacking. Further, we see increasing evidence of a distortion on how forms of personal knowledge, including beliefs and attitudes, are being taken up within segments of the profession; these include legitimizing idiosyncratic positionings and, most worrisome, challenges to the idea that there are and ought to be fundamental truths within nursing that stand as central to disciplinary knowledge. In this paper, the author reflects on the confusion that a continued uncritical deference to personal knowing may be creating and the evolving interests it seems to serve.},

This article presents a case study of a Canadian health care executive who led a remarkable turnaround of St Michael's Health Centre, a floundering and almost bankrupt nursing home. In less than 7 years, Kevin Cowan turned around the finances and changed numerous broken relationships into strategic alliances. Under his leadership, St Michael's Health Centre went from being one of the most underperforming health care organizations in Canada, to one of the most innovative. This article describes some of Cowan's strategies and argues that a servant leadership approach has a direct impact on an organization's ability to innovate. As far as the author is aware, this is the first published article on this specific change effort, which presents a unique perspective on the topics of servant leadership and innovation.Keywords: servant leadership, innovation, Canada, health care, case study},

  abstract = {Summary: "Teaching Autoethnography: Personal Writing in the Classroom is dedicated to the practice of immersive ethnographic and autoethnographic writing that encourages authors to participate in the communities about which they write. This book draws not only on critical qualitative inquiry methods such as interview and observation, but also on theories and sensibilities from creative writing and performance studies, which encourage self-reflection and narrative composition. Concepts from qualitative inquiry studies, which examine everyday life, are combined with approaches to the creation of character and scene to help writers develop engaging narratives that examine chosen subcultures and the author's position in relation to her research subjects. The book brings together a brief history of first-person qualitative research and writing from the past forty years, examining the evolution of nonfiction and qualitative approaches in relation to the personal essay. A selection of recent student writing in the genre as well as reflective student essays on the experience of conducting research in the classroom is presented in the context of exercises for coursework and beyond. Also explored in detail are guidelines for interviewing and identifying subjects and techniques for creating informed sketches and images that engage the reader. This book provides approaches anyone can use to explore their communities and write about them first-hand. The methods presented can be used for a single assignment in a larger course or to guide an entire semester through many levels and varieties of informed personal writing."--Open Textbook Library.},

Several constructs related to the community organization as a social network are proposed and their interrelations are hypothesized in a general research framework. The obtained results test the proposed model providing the most relevant antecedents of the project success. Design/methodology/approach A case study based on Linux ports to non-conventional processor and environments is used to test the proposed model. Structural equation modeling analysis is used to validate the structural proposed model. Findings The main antecedents of online communities' success, quantifying the strength of the relation through the standardized path coefficients. Research limitations/implications The research is limited to a particular set of online communities engaged with the development of the non-conventional Linux ports. However, they constitute a representative set of communities in the field of the open source projects (OSS) development, which are typically developed using a community of support. Originality/value This paper fulfils the main antecedents causing the successful development of Internet virtual communities. Instead of using sources of data coming from users' surveys, this study employs community interactions as a source of data. Results have important implications over the development of online communities, like software business models based on virtual communities and open source software.},

  abstract = {Emotional overeating is a process that is particularly relevant to people within the binge spectrum of eating disorders. Approximately a third of people with overweight share this phenotype. In addition, this behaviour may occur in neurodevelopmental disorders (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)) and other psychiatric disorders. The biopsychosocial underpinnings of emotional eating include a genetic vulnerability to a higher weight and various cognitive and emotional traits. The environment also plays a key role. For example, the commodification of food and beauty and exposure to weight stigma, unpleasant eating experiences and general adversity can set the scene. The majority of people with binge-eating disorder do not seek treatment (perhaps related to internalised stigma and shame). Hence opportunities for early intervention and secondary prevention are lost. Most guidelines for binge-eating disorder (based on the limited available research) recommend forms of cognitive psychotherapies and antidepressants. However, novel treatments that target underlying mechanisms are in development. These include interventions to improve emotional regulation and inhibitory control using neuromodulation and/or brain training. New technologies have been applied to talking therapies, including apps which can offer `just-in-time interventions' or virtual reality or avatar work which can deliver more personalised interventions using complex scenarios. Drugs used for the treatment of ADHD, psychiatric and metabolic disorders may have the potential to be repurposed for binge-eating disorder. Thus, this is an area of rapid change with novel solutions being applied to this problem.},

How can we prepare students to meet the challenges of our century if our schools remain virtually unchanged? This essential resource introduces a framework for 21st century learning that maps out the skills needed to survive and thrive in a complex and connected world. A 21st century education includes knowledge of traditional core subjects such as reading, writing, and arithmetic---but also emphasizes contemporary themes such as global awareness and financial/economic, health, and environmental literacies. Students in 21st century schools will apply their knowledge to understanding and solving real-world challenges using their 21st century skills. Learning and Innovation skills include creativity and innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, and communication and collaboration. Digital literacy skills include information literacy, media literacy, and ICT literacy. The career and life skills include flexibility and adaptability, initiative and self-direction, social and cross-cultural skills, productivity and accountability, leadership and responsibility. The book is filled with classroom vignettes, global examples, schoolwork samples, and includes a DVD with video mini-documentaries of innovative practices that bring the skills to life and offer an exciting view of what teaching and learning can and will look like as we transform learning to meet the demands of the 21st century.

  abstract = {In slang, a troll is a person who posts deliberately offensive or provocative messages online (such as in social media, a newsgroup, a forum, a chat room, an online video game) or who performs similar behaviors in real life. The methods and motivations of trolls can range from benign to sadistic. These messages can be inflammatory, insincere, digressive, extraneous, or off-topic, and may have the intent of provoking others into displaying emotional responses, or manipulating others' perception, thus acting as a bully or a provocateur. The behavior is typically for the troll's amusement, or to achieve a specific result such as disrupting a rival's online activities or purposefully causing confusion or harm to other people. Trolling behaviors involve tactical aggression to incite emotional responses, which can adversely affect the target's well-being. In this context, the noun and the verb forms of "troll" are frequently associated with Internet discourse. Recently, media attention has equated trolling with online harassment. The Courier-Mail and The Today Show have used "troll" to mean "a person who defaces Internet tribute sites with the aim of causing grief to families". In addition, depictions of trolling have been included in popular fictional works, such as the HBO television program The Newsroom, in which a main character encounters harassing persons online and tries to infiltrate their circles by posting negative sexual comments.},

  abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that positive mental health or wellbeing protects against psychopathology. How and why those who flourish derive these resilient outcomes is, however, unknown. This exploratory study investigated if self-compassion, as it continuously provides a friendly, accepting and situational context for negative experiences, functions as a resilience mechanism and adaptive emotion regulation strategy that protects against psychopathology for those with high levels of positive mental health. Participants from the general population (n~=~349) provided measures at one time-point on positive mental health (MHC-SF), self-compassion (SCS-SF), psychopathology (HADS) and negative affect (mDES). Self-compassion significantly mediated the negative relationship between positive mental health and psychopathology. Furthermore, higher levels of self-compassion attenuated the relationship between state negative affect and psychopathology. Findings suggest that especially individuals with high levels of positive mental health possess self-compassion skills that promote resilience against psychopathology. These might function as an adaptive emotion regulation strategy and protect against the activation of schema related to psychopathology following state negative affective experiences. Enhancing self-compassion is a promising positive intervention for clinical practice. It will not only impact psychopathology through reducing factors like rumination and self-criticism, but also improve positive mental health by enhancing factors such as kindness and positive emotions. This may reduce the future risk of psychopathology.},

Digital curation is gradually finding its way into higher education curricula aimed at fostering social media literacies. Teachers are urged to blend informal and formal learning and since most people informally use curation in their daily lives for compiling relevant information, it may be fairly easy to adopt digital curation in teaching and learning. Teachers, however, require considerable insight in incorporating various informal digital curation tools in educational practices. ~The SECTIONS model may assist in guiding decisions around the suitability of digital curation tools for a higher education environment. Including digital literacy training in the professional development of academic staff members may sensitize them to the possibilities that incorporating digital approaches in curricula offer. The Five Cs of Digital Curation framework may guide academic staff members in compiling suitable digital material. There as yet appears not to be a pedagogy that fully acknowledges the various digital curation processes. A pedagogy of abundance, acknowledging that content often is freely available and abundant, may eventually prove relevant in this regard.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The core of Navigating Strategic Possibilities is about stimulating new strategic thinking and action to enhance the competitiveness of a firm. Navigating Strategic Possibilities involves the invention and re-invention of an organisation. Strategic leadership, as a part of this navigation journey, is an integral guiding force of the strategic choices an organisation makes to fulfil its future aspirations. In this book, the key strategic choices related to the competitive advantage and positioning of an organisation are presented in an integrated strategic architecture perspective, and the following seven strategic architecture building blocks are discussed: {$\bullet$} Strategic leadership as a key capacity that gives life, meaning and ongoing momentum to the strategy of an organisation. {$\bullet$} The development of views on the external and internal strategic landscape and context of an organisation. {$\bullet$} Strategy formulation and development which include a menu of strategic options and choices to consider. {$\bullet$} The development of multiple futures perspectives for an organisation. {$\bullet$} Strategy execution practices to make it a lived reality for stakeholders. {$\bullet$} Strategy renewal and innovation practices to refresh the strategy on a continuous basis. {$\bullet$} Entrepreneurial leadership and strategy practices to foster both entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship. The future holds an abundance of possibilities for those conscious enough to spot them. The strategy navigation tools contained in this book provide the identification and execution tools needed to flourish. This book complements the book entitled Crystallising the Strategic Business Landscape by the same authors.},

  author = {{University of Rochester}},
  year = 2020,

  publisher = {YouTube},
  urldate = {2025-02-08},
  abstract = {The algorithms that social media platforms use to recommend who we should ``follow'' are designed to steer us to people who likely share the same ideas and interests. However, platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram could help us become more creative -- a quality that is increasingly valued in our society---if they instead steered us to people with ideas and interests different from our own, say researchers at the University of Rochester. In a new paper in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, they describe conducting a novel experiment in which participants were asked to think of unusual, ``creative'' uses for commonplace items -- using a pencil as a dart, for example, or a shoe as a hammer. They were also given the opportunity to view the ideas of other participants and then decide which of them they would like to ``follow'' for creative inspiration. ``We found that the participants overwhelmingly chose to follow peers who had the most creative ideas,'' says lead author Raiyan Abdul Baten, a PhD student in the human-computer interaction lab of Ehsan Hoque, an associate professor of computer science.  ``We confirmed that following highly creative peers indeed helped people generate novel ideas themselves---the intuition being, if you bump up against out-of-the-box ideas, chances are higher that you will be able to combine your own ideas with ideas you didn't originally think of. Such creative recombinations can lead to further novel ideas.'' However, the researchers also found that when many people share the same sources of inspiration, even their own independently generated ideas can become similar to each other. The finding suggests potential drawbacks if too many people follow a relatively small number of highly creative idea leaders, resulting in a decrease in the overall diversity of thinking across the network. The ``thought leaders'' themselves need to keep generating outlier ideas in order to ``stay relevant and remain ahead of others.'' Members of Hoque's team designed their experiment using a blend of techniques and findings from a variety of fields, including collective intelligence, computer science, the psychology of creativity, and network design. Their findings bridge a ``huge research gap,'' Baten says, documenting for the first time the network-level dynamics that occur when people are presented with divergent ideas in a web-based setting. In order to replicate those dynamics, participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk were divided into two sets of ``nodes'' in a simulated social network. Participants assigned to nodes as ``alters'' independently came up with ideas for alternative uses for commonplace objects. Participants placed in nodes as ``egos'' were each connected to two of the ``alters.'' After spending three minutes generating their own ideas, the ``egos'' were then allowed to see the ideas of their ``alters'' and were given three additional minutes to list further ideas. The ``egos'' were then asked to rate the novelty of the ideas suggested by all of the ``alters'' and, finally, to choose whether to continue following the two ``alters'' they were initially assigned or instead follow others. This process was repeated five rounds, each time the participants coming up with alternative uses for a different commonplace object. The relative ``creativity'' of the ideas was rated in three ways: 1. By other study participants who were not assigned to any of the nodes 2. Giving more points to ideas less frequently suggested 3. By using natural language processing to help determine which participants had a wider variety of ideas, and therefore were more creative The researchers will continue to extend the scope of the experiment, examining for example, how the gender and race of participants may influence outcomes.  Gourab Ghoshal, associate professor of physics, mathematics and computer science at Rochester who was also part of the work. ``There has been a lot of work on the optimal topologies (putting people together in the right way) to enhance team performance,'' he says. ``This, however, has been treated from a static context. In reality, social networks are constantly evolving, and the counterintuitive results presented here, suggests the situation is far more complex. This has profound implications in how people interact on social media, or indeed, work together in teams.''  Other authors include James Bagrow, associate professor of mathematics and statistics at the University of Vermont; and Daryl Bagley, a PhD student, and Ashely Tenesaca and Famous Clark, undergraduate researchers, in Hoque's lab. The project was supported with funding from the National Science Foundation.

  abstract = {This video is an explanation of the difference between modernism and postmodernism. Summary of Differences {$\bullet$} Modernism began in the 1890s and lasted till about 1945. {$\bullet$} Postmodernism began after the Second World War, especially after 1968. {$\bullet$} Modernism's aim was criticism of the bourgeois social order of the 19th century and its world view.  {$\bullet$} The first use of the term postmodernism dates back to the 1870s. John Watkins Chapman referred to a postmodern style of painting which differed from French Impressionism. J.M. Thompson used the term to refer to changes in attitudes and beliefs in religion. {$\bullet$} Low forms of culture was a part of modernism. Simplicity and elegance in design are the characteristics of modernism. {$\bullet$} Postmodern art brought high and low culture together by using industrial materials and pop culture imagery. Postmodern art is decorative. {$\bullet$} Modernism was based on using rational and logical means to gain knowledge. It rejected realism. A hierarchical, organized, and determinate nature of knowledge characterized modernism. {$\bullet$} Postmodernism denied the application of logical thinking. Rather, the thinking during the postmodern era was based on an unscientific, irrational thought process, as a reaction to modernism. {$\bullet$} Modernism is based on European and Western thought.  {$\bullet$} Postmodernists believe in multiculturalism. {$\bullet$} Modernist approach was objective, theoretical, and analytical.  {$\bullet$} Postmodernism was based on an anarchical, non-totalized, and indeterminate state of knowledge. {$\bullet$} Modernist thinking is about the search of an abstract truth of life.  {$\bullet$} Postmodernist thinkers believe that there is no universal truth, abstract or otherwise. {$\bullet$} Modernism attempts to construct a coherent world-view.  {$\bullet$} Postmodernism attempts to remove the difference between high and low. {$\bullet$} Modernist thinking asserts that mankind progresses by using science and reason. It believes in learning from past experiences and trusts the texts that narrate the past. {$\bullet$} Postmodernists believe that progress is the only way to justify the European domination on culture. They defy any truth in the text narrating the past and render it of no use in the present times. {$\bullet$} Modernist historians believe in depth. They believe in going deep into a subject to fully analyze it.  {$\bullet$} Postmodernist thinkers believe in going by superficial appearances, they believe in playing on surfaces and show less or no concern towards the depth of subjects. {$\bullet$} Modernist historians believe in depth.

In the 1970s, postmodern movement entered music. In art and architecture, it began to establish itself in the early 1980s. The exact year when modernism ended, and whether it ended is debatable.  {$\bullet$} It is considered that postmodernism started going out of fashion around the late 1990s, and was replaced by post-postmodernism which has developed from and is a reaction to postmodernism. Metamodernism is a related term that was first used by Zavarzadeh in 1975 to describe aesthetics and attitudes emerging in the American literature in the mid-1950s. Sources: Modernism/Postmodernism.

He asks us to join a listening revolution, and promises that if we all just listen a little bit more, we can transform any relationship. William Ury, cofounder of Harvard's Program on Negotiation, is one of the world's best-known and most influential experts on negotiation. He is the coauthor of Getting to Yes, the bestselling negotiation book in the world, and has taught negotiation to tens of thousands of people, has consulted for dozens of Fortune 500 companies, and has served as a consultant to the White House.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Leadership is about knowledge, skills, and abilities for transformation. It is also increasingly about worldviews or               visions of life               ---beliefs, values, and principles. But worldviews are also               ways of life               , for beliefs direct us, values guide us, and principles motivate us to certain kinds of action and behavior.                                         How, then, do worldviews have an impact on leadership for transformation? If worldviews are glasses or filters by which we view the world, mental models of the               bigger picture               , frameworks by which we make sense of the world, and narratives by which we orient our lives, then how do they influence human thoughts, ideas, and behaviors when it comes to transformative leadership?                                         This was the subject matter of an International Leadership Association Conference panel discussion held in November 2009 in Prague, entitled               Leadership for Transformation: The Impact of Worldviews               . It is also the subject matter of this issue's symposium, in which we bring you the four papers and the response presented at the conference. Members of the panel were characterized by gender, disciplinary, religious, and global diversity.                                         Nathan Harter, organizational leadership professor at Purdue University in the United States, begins the discussion with some preliminary remarks about worldviews. Ali Mohammed Mir, medical doctor and director of programs of Population Council, Pakistan, speaks of leadership from an Islamic perspective. Michael Jones, accomplished composer, pianist, and leadership educator, writer, and speaker from Orillia, Canada, reflects on how a ``marriage of               mythos               and               logos               '' can transform leadership today. Lisa Ncube, originally from Zimbabwe and currently assistant professor of organizational leadership at Purdue University, speaks about Ubuntu as an alternative leadership philosophy emerging from Africa. John Valk, associate professor of worldview studies at Renaissance College, University of New Brunswick, Canada, speaks of leadership for transformation from a Christian worldview perspective. Jonathan Reams, associate professor in the Department of Education at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, responds to all of the papers and opens a venue for further discussion.                          We hope that you will find this symposium engaging. We hope it will give food for thought and that it might stimulate further thinking regarding the role worldviews play in leadership for transformation.},

Veterans and their families deal with the painful aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four grew up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical violence. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, one of the world's foremost experts on trauma, has spent over three decades working with survivors. In The Body Keeps the Score, he uses recent scientific advances to show how trauma literally reshapes both body and brain, compromising sufferers' capacities for pleasure, engagement, self-control, and trust. He explores innovative treatments---from neurofeedback and meditation to sports, drama, and yoga---that offer new paths to recovery by activating the brain's natural neuroplasticity. Based on Dr. van der Kolk's own research and that of other leading specialists, The Body Keeps the Score exposes the tremendous power of our relationships both to hurt and to heal---and offers new hope for reclaiming lives.},

Teaching behaviors were observed using the International Comparative Analysis of Learning and Teaching (ICALT) observation protocol. Using Rasch analysis, the study reveals that 31 of 32 effective teaching behaviors fit cumulative ordering. The ordering also parallels descriptions of teacher development.

This article presents a case study of a Canadian health care executive who led a remarkable turnaround of St Michael\&\#39;s Health Centre, a floundering and almost bankrupt nursing home. In less than 7 years, Kevin Cowan turned around the finances and changed numerous broken relationships into strategic alliances. Under his leadership, St Michael\&\#39;s Health Centre went from being one of the most underperforming health care organizations in Canada, to one of the most innovative. This article describes some of Cowan\&\#39;s strategies and argues that a servant leadership approach has a direct impact on an organization\&\#39;s ability to innovate. As far as the author is aware, this is the first published article on this specific change effort, which presents a unique perspective on the topics of servant leadership and innovation.Keywords: servant leadership, innovation, Canada, health care, case study},

As more nurse scholars and nurse researchers utilize phenomenology as a research approach, it becomes critical to examine the implications this may have for nursing knowledge development and for the utilization of that knowledge in practice. In this paper, an examination of the results of phenomenological inquiry is presented and compared with the types of knowledge considered important for nursing by Carper and White. It is clear that phenomenology contributes to empirical, moral, aesthetic, personal, and socio-political knowledge development. Its contribution is not in developing predictive and prescriptive theory, but in revealing the nature of human experience. Although interpretive inquiry, such as hermeneutic phenomenology, does not prescribe action for use in clinical practice, it does influence a thoughtful reflective attentive practice by its revealing of the meanings of human experience.},

This review deals with the historical background of servant leadership, its key characteristics, the available measurement tools, and the results of relevant studies that have been conducted so far. An overall conceptual model of servant leadership is presented. It is argued that leaders who combine their motivation to lead with a need to serve display servant leadership. Personal characteristics and culture are positioned alongside the motivational dimension. Servant leadership is demonstrated by empowering and developing people; by expressing humility, authenticity, interpersonal acceptance, and stewardship; and by providing direction. A high-quality dyadic relationship, trust, and fairness are expected to be the most important mediating processes to encourage self-actualization, positive job attitudes, performance, and a stronger organizational focus on sustainability and corporate social responsibility.},

Aim: We aimed to retrospectively identify risk factors for attempted suicide during outpatient care and predict which young people did or did not attempt during care. Method: Penalized logistic regression analysis was performed in a small high-risk sample of 84 young people receiving care at Orygen's Youth Mood Clinic (age: 14--25 years, 51\% female) to predict suicide attempt during care (N = 16). Results: Prediction of suicide attempt during care was only moderately accurate (Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve range 0.71; sensitivity 0.57) using a combination of sociodemographic, psychosocial, and clinical variables. The features that best discriminated both groups included suicidal ideation during care, history of suicide attempt prior to care, changes in appetite reported on the PHQ-9, history of parental separation, and parental mental illness. Limitation: Replication of findings in an independent validation sample is needed. Conclusion: While prediction of suicide attempt during care was only moderately successful, we were able to identify individual risk factors for suicidal behavior during care in a high-risk sample.

  abstract = {Aim This discursive paper aims to bring to the foreground the ongoing influence of Cartesian dualism and other important contextual complexities on breastfeeding in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Background Breastfeeding is widely supported as the optimal form of nutrition for the first 6 months of life and beyond. Amidst a myriad of contextual factors, current breastfeeding rates are below globally targeted goals. For premature and/or critically ill infants, the importance of receiving breast milk is often encouraged based on its immunological and nutritive benefits as opposed to the entirety of the breastfeeding interaction, underscoring the influence of dualism in the NICU. Design The impact of Cartesian dualism and other sociocultural underpinnings of breastfeeding focused within the NICU environment are illustrated through a critical, philosophical discussion. Methods Relevant historical context is provided followed by an overview of the realities of contemporary breastfeeding. These are presented as a frame of reference for the NICU breastfeeding experiences currently encountered by many mothers of preterm and critically ill neonates, further illustrated using a clinical exemplar as well as the author's own observations from neonatal nursing practice. Relevance to clinical practice Shifting away from a dualistic approach requires rethinking breastfeeding support interactions between NICU nurses and mothers. To address the disembodied and often mechanistic approach to care inherent in the dominant Western medical model, a relational approach to breastfeeding support in the NICU is suggested and discussed. Conclusion Future research from a more critical lens is needed to examine the complex dynamics involved when nurses and mothers are negotiating decisions and processes related to infant feeding. In focusing on the relational dimensions of the breastfeeding experience, nurses can resist the dualistic influence and dominant discourses impacting infant feeding and motherhood in the 21st century.},

The study demonstrates that organizations have distinct types of ethical climates and that there is variance in the ethical climate within organizations by position, tenure, and workgroup membership. Five empirically derived dimensions of ethical climate are described: law and code, caring, instrumentalism, independence, and rules. Analyses of variance reveal significant differences in ethical climates both across and within firms. A theory of ethical climates is developed from organization and economic theory to describe the determinants of ethical climates in organizations. In particular, the sociocultural environment, organizational form, and organization-specific history are identified as determinants of the ethical climates in organizations. The implications of ethical climate for organizational theory are also discussed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis addressed the efficacy of psychotherapeutic interventions to help people forgive others and to examine moderators of treatment effects. METHOD: Eligible studies reported quantitative data on forgiveness of a specific hurt following treatment by a professional with an intervention designed explicitly to promote forgiveness. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted using k = 53 posttreatment effect sizes (N = 2,323) and k = 41 follow-up effect sizes (N = 1,716) from a total of 54 published and unpublished research reports. RESULTS: Participants receiving explicit forgiveness treatments reported significantly greater forgiveness than participants not receiving treatment ({$\Delta$}+ = 0.56 [0.43, 0.68]) and participants, receiving alternative treatments ({$\Delta$}+ = 0.45 [0.21, 0.69]). Also, forgiveness treatments resulted in greater changes in depression, anxiety, and hope than no-treatment conditions. Moderators of treatment efficacy included treatment dosage, offense severity, treatment model, and treatment modality. Multimoderator analyses indicated that treatment dosage (i.e., longer interventions) and modality (individual {$>$} group) uniquely predicted change in forgiveness compared with no-treatment controls. Compared with alternative treatment conditions, both modality (individual {$>$} group) and offense severity were marginally predictive (ps {$<$} .10) of treatment effects. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that using theoretically grounded forgiveness interventions is a sound choice for helping clients to deal with past offenses and helping them achieve resolution in the form of forgiveness. Differences between treatment approaches disappeared when controlling for other significant moderators; the advantage for individual interventions was most clearly demonstrated for Enright-model interventions, as there have been no studies of individual interventions using the Worthington model.},

For this analysis, the authors used multilevel statistical procedures, in which therapists were treated as a random factor. When the initial level of severity was taken into account, about 5\% of the variation in outcomes was due to therapists. Patient age, gender, and diagnosis as well as therapist age, gender, experience, and professional degree accounted for little of the variability in outcomes among therapists. Whether or not patients were receiving psychotropic medication concurrently with psychotherapy did affect therapist variability. However, the patients of the more effective therapists received more benefit from medication than did the patients of less effective therapists.

This measure was shown to have good internal consistency and temporal stability. The GRAT was shown to relate positively to various measures of SWB. In two experiments, it was shown that grateful thinking improved mood, and results also supported the predictive validity of the GRAT. These studies support the theory that gratitude is an affective trait important to SWB.},

We argue that the metaphors of `place' and `tool' most appropriately represent the use of technology in contemporary society, especially given the advent of social media. The Visitors and Residents continuum accounts for people behaving in different ways when using technology, depending on their motivation and context, without categorising them according to age or background.

With their first book, Extreme Ownership (published in October 2015), Jocko Willink and Leif Babin set a new standard for leadership, challenging readers to become better leaders, better followers, and better people, in both their professional and personal lives. Now, in THE DICHOTOMY OF LEADERSHIP, Jocko and Leif dive even deeper into the unchartered and complex waters of a concept first introduced in Extreme Ownership: finding balance between the opposing forces that pull every leader in different directions. Here, Willink and Babin get granular into the nuances that every successful leader must navigate. Mastering the Dichotomy of Leadership requires understanding when to lead and when to follow; when to aggressively maneuver and when to pause and let things develop; when to detach and let the team run and when to dive into the details and micromanage. In addition, every leader must:{$\cdot$} Take Extreme Ownership of everything that impacts their mission, yet utilize Decentralize Command by giving ownership to their team. {$\cdot$} Care deeply about their people and their individual success and livelihoods, yet look out for the good of the overall team and above all accomplish the strategic mission. {$\cdot$} Exhibit the most important quality in a leader{\texthorizontalbar}humility, but also be willing to speak up and push back against questionable decisions that could hurt the team and the mission.With examples from the authors' combat and training experiences in the SEAL teams, and then a demonstration of how each lesson applies to the business world, Willink and Babin clearly explain THE DICHOTOMY OF LEADERSHIP{\texthorizontalbar}skills that are mission-critical for any leader and any team to achieve their ultimate goal: VICTORY.},

Now with an excerpt from the authors' new book, THE DICHOTOMY OF LEADERSHIP. Combat, the most intense and dynamic environment imaginable, teaches the toughest leadership lessons, with absolutely everything at stake. Jocko Willink and Leif Babin learned this reality first-hand on the most violent and dangerous battlefield in Iraq. As leaders of SEAL Team Three's Task Unit Bruiser, their mission was one many thought impossible: help U.S. forces secure Ramadi, a violent, insurgent-held city deemed ``all but lost.'' In gripping, firsthand accounts of heroism, tragic loss, and hard-won victories, they learned that leadership{\texthorizontalbar}at every level{\texthorizontalbar}is the most important factor in whether a team succeeds or fails. Willink and Babin returned home from deployment and instituted SEAL leadership training to pass on their harsh lessons of self-discipline, mental toughness and self-defense learned in combat to help forge the next generation of SEAL leaders. After leaving the SEAL Teams, they launched a company, Echelon Front, to teach those same leadership principles to leaders in businesses, companies, and organizations across the civilian sector. Since that time, they have trained countless leaders and worked with hundreds of companies in virtually every industry across the U.S. and internationally, teaching them how to develop their own high-performance teams and most effectively lead those teams to dominate their battlefields.Since it's release in October 2015, Extreme Ownership has revolutionized leadership development and set a new standard for literature on the subject. Required reading for many of the most successful organizations, it has become an integral part of the official leadership training programs for scores of business teams, military units, and first responders. Detailing the resilient mindset and total focus principles that enable SEAL units to accomplish the most difficult combat missions, Extreme Ownership demonstrates how to apply them to any team or organization, in any leadership environment. A compelling narrative with powerful instruction and direct application, Extreme Ownership challenges leaders everywhere to fulfill their ultimate purpose: lead and win.},

Background Health inequity is a global issue, which occurs across and within countries, and is the greatest barrier to worldwide health and the development of the human race. In response to this challenge, there is an international commitment to ensure universal health coverage based on the fundamental principle that individuals should be able to access healthcare services they need. Despite this, there is clear evidence that indigenous and other cultural minorities such as New Zealand M{\=a}ori and Gypsy Roma Travellers still experience far poorer health outcomes when compared to the majority population. Furthermore, when they do access health care, their experiences are often not positive and this in turn results in reluctance to access preventative health care, instead accessing health services much later, reducing treatment options and compounding higher mortality rates. What is often not explored or examined is the impact of the different cultural beliefs of individuals in these communities and the nurses caring for them. Design This is a position paper drawing upon research experience with New Zealand M{\=a}ori and Gypsy Roma Travellers. We critically review the experiences of health inequity of marginalised communities. It does so by examining how these communities may have a different world view to the nurses caring for them, and it is this lack of understanding and valuing of alternative worldviews that contributes to the poorer health outcomes both communities face. Conclusion and relevance to clinical practice As nurses work with many different individuals and groups, we have to find ways of ensuring a more embracing, culturally responsive healthcare environment which respects and values the beliefs of others.},

Authentic leadership is proposed as the core of effective leadership needed to build trust because of its clear focus on the positive role modeling of honesty, integrity, and high ethical standards in the development of leader-follower relationships. A model linking authentic leadership behaviors with trust in management, perceptions of supportive groups and work outcomes (including voice or speaking-up behavior, self-rated job performance, and burnout) using secondary analysis procedures was examined. The hypothesized model was tested using structural equation modeling in two samples of health care employees from a western Canadian cancer care agency: clinical care providers including nurses, pharmacists, physicians, and other professionals (N = 147) and nonclinical employees including administrative, support, and research staff (N = 188). Findings suggest that supportive leader behavior and trust in management are necessary for staff to be willing to voice concerns and offer suggestions to improve the workplace and patient care.},

This study examined how organizational newcomers sought information during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic without such possibility. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 30 individuals who began jobs remotely between February and November 2020, we uncovered three major areas of uncertainty: workplace relationships, task/role performance, and organizational norms. Our findings demonstrate how these newcomers managed the uncertainties through six information seeking tactics: organizing virtual small talks; initiating unsanctioned in-person meetings; asking overt and targeted questions; utilizing digital repositories; unintentional limit testing; and anticipating future information seeking. We discuss implications for remote newcomer socialization and provide propositions for future research.},

How do we come to know ourselves in terms of our personalities, and more importantly, potential? Well, one of the first ways to come to know yourself is to understand that you don't.  You know, you can learn to kind of watch yourself like you're watching a stranger. But you have to adopt a position---this is a position of radical humility, I would say---humility in two senses. So, one sense would be: humility of recognizing your ignorance. So you have to understand that you don't know who you are. And that's not easy to understand, because you think you know, but then you know, you remember you can't control yourself very well, you're not very disciplined, you're full of flaws, maybe you don't know yourself as well as you think. But it's hard to get low enough to understand how deeply it is the case that you are ignorant about who you are. Now, there's an upside to that, too, which also is that you're also ignorant about who you could be. And so, the discovery of that, you know, is some reward for the horror of determining who you actually are. Then I would say, well---then you watch yourself. You watch yourself like you're watching a stranger. You watch what you say and you listen. You think, well, what sort of person would say that? And how am I reacting emotionally when I'm communicating in that manner? Is that making me feel stronger or weaker? Is it filling me with shame? Is it helping my confidence? Am I laying out a lie? Am I deceiving myself and other people? Am I adopting this personality at parties that is designed to impress and to amuse and it comes across as nothing but self centered narcissism? What are my dark fantasies? What are my aggressive fantasies? What is it that I'm willing to do? What am I interested in so that I'll spontaneously pursue it? What do I procrastinate about and why? What am I unwilling to do? What do I think is good? What do I congratulate myself for accomplishing? And what do I berate myself for failing to confront and to implement? Those are all incredibly complicated questions and you don't know the answers to them. So that's---that's a start. And then, in terms of potential, well, you'll discover a little bit more about your potential as you discover who you are, especially the darker parts about yourself, because then you discover your potential for mayhem. There's some real utility in that. It's actually something that strengthens you, because the first thing that a realization like that can in fact produce is the ambition to incorporate that dangerousness into a higher order personality, and that can make you implacable. That can make you someone who can say ``no'' when you need to say ``no.'' You know? That can make you someone who won't avoid necessary conflict. And so that's unbelievably useful. And so that's one of the potentials that you might discover. The other thing you do to discover your potential is to---well you challenge yourself. You know, it's like---Rule 4 in my book ``12 Rules for Life'' is: compare yourself to who you were yesterday and not to who someone else is today, and that's kind of a good way to start this... ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂ Fair Use Disclaimer: Our purpose is to produce quality, educational and motivational video content, and to share it with our viewers.

While it is easy to see the emotional benefits of forgiveness, actually forgiving a transgressor can be difficult. And the process may be either helped or hindered by the way one relates to the sacred. In some cases, spiritual transformation may be needed before one is able to forgive. This book presents a model of forgiveness and relational spirituality based on clinical practice and supported by empirical research. Worthington and Sandage bring together decades of experience as both researchers and clinicians to show the differing ways in which spiritual and religious experiences can shape concerns, values, and practices that may facilitate or hinder forgiveness among clients. Their model highlights relational factors (attachment and differentiation) and action-oriented interventions for emotion regulation. Applications are described for short-term therapy, long-term therapy, couple and family therapy, and group therapy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)},

Character (ethos) refers to those inter-penetrable habitual qualities within individuals and applicable to organizations that constrain and lead them to desire and pursue personal and societal good. In our review, we first provide an initial conceptualization of character, partly by distinguishing it from virtue and values. Second, starting with the Old Testament, we examine how character has traditionally been considered across time and culture. Next, we discuss the extant research on strength of character and organizational virtue. We conclude with promising research directions involving individual character strength and organizational virtue.},

For many people, depression turns out to be one of the most disabling illnesses that we have in society. Despite the treatments that we have available, many people are not responding that well. It's a disorder that can be very disabling in society. It's also a disorder that has medical consequences. By understand the neurobiology of depression we hope to be able more to find the right treatment for the patient suffering from this disease.  The current standard of care for the treatment of depression is based on what we call the monoamine deficiency hypothesis. Essentially, presuming that one of three neurotransmitters in the brain is deficient or underactive. But the reality is, there are more than 100 neurotransmitters in the brain. And billions of connections between neurons. So we know that that's a limited hypothesis. Neurotransmitters can be thought of as the chemical messengers within the brain, it's what helps one cell in the brain communicate with another, to pass that message along from one brain region to another. For decades, we thought that the primary pathology, the primary cause of depression was some abnormality in these neurotransmitters, specifically serotonin or norepinephrine. However, norepinephrine and serotonin did not seem to be able to account for this cause, or to cause the symptoms of depression in people who had major depression. Instead, the chemical messengers between the nerve cells in the higher centers of the brain, which include glutamate and GABA, were possibilities as alternative causes for the symptoms of depression. When you're exposed to severe and chronic stress like people experience when they have depression, you lose some of the connections between the nerve cells. The communication in these circuits becomes inefficient and noisy, we think that the loss of these synaptic connections contributes to the biology of depression. There are clear differences between a healthy brain and a depressed brain. And the exciting thing is, when you treat that depression effectively, the brain goes back to looking like a healthy brain, both at the cellular level and at a global scale. It's critical to understand the neurobiology of depression and how the brain plays a role in that for two main reasons. One, it helps us understand how the disease develops and progresses, and we can start to target treatments based on that. We are in a new era of psychiatry. This is a paradigm shift, away from a model of monoaminergic deficiency to a fuller understanding of the brain as a complex neurochemical organ. All of the research is driven by the imperative to alleviate human suffering. Depression is one of the most substantial contributors to human suffering. The opportunity to make even a tiny dent in that is an incredible opportunity. 0:00 Depression \& the brain 0:46 Neurobiology 2:17 New treatment approaches}

How do you build an organization that is responsive to fast-changing markets? What kind of organization delivers both speed and scale, and how do you lead it?Arthur Yeung and Dave Ulrich provide leaders with a much-needed blueprint for reinventing the organization. Based on their in-depth research at leading Chinese, US, and European firms such as Alibaba, Amazon, DiDi, Facebook, Google, Huawei, Supercell, and Tencent, and drawing from their synthesis of the latest organization research and practice, Yeung and Ulrich explain how to build a new kind of organization (a "market-oriented ecosystem") that responds to changing market opportunities with speed and scale. While other books address individual pieces of the puzzle, Reinventing the Organization offers a practical, integrated, six-step framework and looks at all the decisions leaders need to make--choosing the right strategies, capabilities, structure, culture, management tools, and leadership--to deliver radically greater value in fast-moving markets.For any leader eager to build a stronger, more responsive organization and for all those in HR, organizational development, and consulting who will shape and deliver it, this book provides a much-needed roadmap for reinvention.},

As her talk explains, fathers are crucial in the upbringing and development of their children; and 2. Fathers are the disadvantaged parent in family court and society and while the laws are improving, the statistics are not. There are currently more than 17,000,000 children growing up in America without their fathers and every year this number is growing. According to the Center for Disease Control, children from fatherless homes account for 90\% of homeless and runaway children; 71\% of high school dropouts and 63\% of youth suicides. Listen to this talk to find out how you can help America's 17,000,000 fatherless children avoid these fates!  Marilyn D. York is a Men's Rights Divorce Attorney, licensed in California since 1998 and Nevada since 1999, where she is a Certified Family Law Specialist. Since 2001, Marilyn has owned her law firm in Reno, Nevada, where she and her 9 female employees specifically represent men in divorce and family law battles. Marilyn chose her career because of her passion for children and relationships but most of all, Marilyn is driven to help underdogs. While the laws are improving for men, not all laws are yet gender equal and the interpretation and enforcement of those that are, have a long way to go. Despite her focus on representing men, Marilyn has a deep compassion for women in need as well. It isn't lost on Marilyn that women remain disadvantaged outside Family Court. She serves that need as Board President for a local housing program for homeless young women, Nevada Youth Empowerment Project, or NYEP.

Most famous among hisphilosophical writings is the short but powerful book I andThou (1923) where our relation to others is considered astwofold.  The I-it relation prevails between subjects andobjects of thought and action; the I-Thou relation, on theother hand, obtains in encounters between subjects that exceed therange of the Cartesian subject-object relation. Though originallyplanned as a prolegomenon to a phenomenology of religion, I andThou proved influential in other areas as well, including thephilosophy of education. The work of Martin Buber remains a linchpinof qualitative philosophical anthropology and continues to be cited infields such as philosophical psychology, medical anthropology, andpedagogical theory.  Buber's writings on Jewish nationalrenaissance, Hasidism, and political philosophy made him a majortwentieth-century figure in Jewish thought and the philosophy ofreligion. Buber's extensive writing on the political dimensions of biblical historiography and prophetic literature not only made contributions to the history of religion but also to contemporary discussions on political theology with an anarchistic bent. His translation, with Franz Rosenzweig, of the Hebrew Bible into German remains a classic in the German language.},
