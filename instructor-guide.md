## GX Course Delivery

This course is offered in two modalities: GX Live & GX Prime. 

### GX Live (Facilitated):

-   **Course Content:** In this modality, students work through the course
    material in Moodle according to the course schedule, submitting assignments
    by assigned due dates. 

-   **Live sessions:** Students attend weekly Learning Labs led by a
    facilitator.  In the labs, students engage in various learning activities,
    discussions, and assignment preparation.  The labs are 2 hours each week,
    and students must attend **75%** of the labs.  

-   **Instructor role:** The role of the instructor is to give feedback to
    students on assignments and answer questions from facilitators and students.
    Note some instructors choose to be present for some labs (see examples in
    the Facilitation Orientation website
    [here](https://twuonline.github.io/facilitation-meta-guide/#/orientation?id=interaction-with-the-instructors)).

-   **Key Resources for GX Live:**

    -   For more information on this model, see the [Facilitation
        Meta-Guide](https://twuonline.github.io/facilitation-meta-guide/#/orientation).

    -   See [Facilitator’s
        Guides](https://twuonline.github.io/facilitator-guides/#/) that outline
        the lab activities and instructions for facilitators.

### GX Prime (Online Asynchronous):

-   **Course Content:** In this modality, students work through the course in
    Moodle at their own pace.  They have 6 weeks to submit the *three required
    assignments*.

-   **Online Community**: Students will be encouraged to engage with the online
    community through Discourse, as well as Moodle discussion forums, and
    optional Live sessions.  See the section below on the Online Learning Hub.

-   **Instructor role:** The instructor is responsible for giving feedback and
    assigning a grade for the three assignments. Instructors and/or facilitators
    are also encouraged to send out reminder emails or announcements to keep
    students on track. These motivational messages may re-engage students that
    may have decided not to complete the course assignments.

### Online Learning Hub (Asynchronous Resources & Synchronous Sessions)

-   All GX students (Live & Prime) will have the support of the Online Learning
    Hub, which will include “Just In Time” support from facilitators, online
    resources, and regular live sessions.  

-   The live sessions will be optional and will cover general topics for online
    learning, such as writing support, study skills, and community building. The
    purpose is for students to connect with their peers and facilitators and
    have a robust support system.

## Instructor To-Do List For GX Live

There are a few things you should do before the semester starts to ensure that your students have a smooth transition to studying with you.  

✔️ Receive confirmation of course code and Moodle access info.

✔️ Import content from your previous cohort. If yours is a new course, the Online team can add you to the Master course shell so you can import from there to your new section. If importing from a previous course, delete items that you no longer need. See here for instructions.

✔️ Add a syllabus: You will need to change the dates in the syllabus, make sure it is a pdf version, get approval from the department chair, and upload it to Moodle on the Course Introduction tab.

✔️ Add a welcome message: Add an Announcement forum at the bottom of the Course Introduction page. to welcome your new students, tell them about yourself and how to reach you (e.g. email), and perhaps share an encouraging Bible verse or what interests you about this course. This could be the first connection point with your learners to welcome them to Trinity's online learning community. 
Consider adding a personal welcome video, or photo of yourself! It may go a long way to ease students' anxieties and motivate them to succeed in your course. 

✔️ Edit the Schedule tab in Moodle.  Although you may have a detailed schedule in your syllabus, you may want to use this editable page that details key information for each week, including:  
- key resources students need to read/watch;  
- important ungraded learning activities that will help them complete an assignment;
- information on which activities to complete before/after a Learning Lab session.

✔️ Check the course materials: You may notice that this fully developed online course has a lot of material, including videos, unit writing, and external links. If possible, please check for broken links and send a message to our online team (elearning@twu.ca) so we can help you fix any errors.

✔️ Check the Assignment details and due dates: Due dates should be found in your course syllabus, but they may also be in your Discussion Forums and/or Assignment dropboxes. Please check that those dates are correct. Also add or edit the Assignment dropboxes (if they are missing). Confirm assessment details, such as due dates (can be added to the title of dropboxes if desired).

✔️ Check the Gradebook: Please double check that all assessment material is correct, including the percentages in the course Gradebook.

✔️ Prepare for Synchronous sessions: If you have synchronous Zoom Meetings in your course, you will need to become familiar with the following:
- Scheduling class meetings
- Recording Zoom Meetings
- Adding the recorded session to Microsoft Stream
- Embedding videos into Moodle See the following guide for details: Managing Videos | TWU Learning Environment Help Pages
  
✔️ Use Announcements for Weekly encouragement and review.

✔️ Course Visibility: Your course is visible to you as the instructor, but it is hidden from students. When you are ready, follow these instructions to make your course visible to students. Your course will move from the 'Future' tab on your dashboard to the 'In progress' tab on the date indicated in the 'Start date' field of the course settings.
