## Engage With Your Community {.unnumbered}

Community is key to learning at TWU, even in online courses. Connecting with others enhances your experience, provides support, and fosters a sense of belonging.

**The Learning Community on Discourse** is our online discussion platform where you can:

- Connect with fellow students, ask course-related questions, and share insights.
- Participate in course, program, and university-wide discussions.
- Engage with Facilitators for resources, study skills, and live support.

**Ways to Connect:**

- **Online Discussions** – Join course forums, seek advice, and collaborate.
- **Instructor Interaction** – Check Learning Community for updates, ask questions, and get feedback.
- **University Events & Workshops** – See information for upcoming virtual events, webinars, and interest groups.
- **Virtual Study Groups** – Form or join study groups using the Learning Community. Contact your facilitator for assistance setting up a group.

Take the initiative to connect, learn, and grow—your engagement will enrich your academic journey and help build lasting relationships.
