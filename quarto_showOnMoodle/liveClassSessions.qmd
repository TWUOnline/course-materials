-   Practical tips for assignments

-   Live Q&A

**Additional Notes About Live Sessions**

**Chat Transcripts:** Chats are automatically saved and can be reviewed afterward by opening the Chat panel in MS Teams and selecting the meeting title.

**Privacy Considerations:** Instructors may turn off chat or pause recordings during sensitive discussions to respect privacy.

**Recording Exceptions:** Most sessions are recorded, but some activities (e.g., breakout rooms, whiteboards, polls, collaborative docs) may not be captured. Instructors will let you know when recordings are paused or unavailable.-->
